# Knowledge Base

The KronoDeskÂ® online knowledge base provides the first level of support
to customers. Instead of having to constantly respond to the same
routine enquiries and support requests, customer support agents can use
the built-in knowledge base to create articles related to different
topics, categories and products. Knowledge base articles can be linked
to multiple categories and also tagged with meta-tags to make searching
easier by customers. The system includes full rich-text editor so that
articles can be formatted with lists, tables, different text styles and
embedded hyperlinks.

When a user starts entering a support ticket, KronoDesk automatically
scans the available KB articles to suggest a response before they submit
the ticket.
