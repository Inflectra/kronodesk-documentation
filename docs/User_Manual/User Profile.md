To update your user's profile, view your list of tickets,
threads/replies, draft KB articles or change your password, simply click
on your username in the top-right of the application header. The system

This page will display your user's name, login, email address, date of
registration, culture/locale, timezone, linked SpiraTeam login and RSS
Token (also known as the API Key), avatar image and a list of the roles
that your user belongs to.

Underneath this section the system will display a list of help desk
tickets, draft KB articles, forum threads and thread replies that you
have posted. To edit your profile, click on the 'Edit Profile' button.

You can update the following fields on this page:

-   **Login ID** -- the username that you'd like to use in the system.
This has to be unique.

be sent to.

-   **First Name** -- your first name

-   **Last Name** -- your last name

-   **Middle Initial** -- your middle initial (if applicable)

-   **Culture/Locale** -- choose a specific culture/locale for your
user. This will determine which language pack is used by the
application and what date format is used

-   **Timezone** -- choose a specific timezone for your user. This will
determine the timezone that dates will be displayed in the
application

-   **RSS Token** -- used to allow you view secure KronoDesk RSS
newsfeeds from outside the system

-   **Password** -- enter your current password if you plan on changing
the password question/answer. If you don't need to change the
password question/answer, you can leave this blank.

-   **Security Question/Answer** -- enter a question that only you will
know the answer to, together with the matching answer to that
question.

-   **Spira Login** -- You need to enter a valid login for SpiraTeam
that corresponds to your user. This allows you to view SpiraTeam
incidents linked to a specific KronoDesk help desk ticket.

-   **Spira Api Key** -- You need to enter the SpiraTeam RSS token (also
known as the API-Key) for the SpiraTeam user specified above.

-   **Avatar** - Each user in KronoDesk can have a small graphic icon
(called an avatar) associated with their account. This icon will be
displayed next to forum posts, ticket comments, etc. You can click
on the \[Browse\] button to change your avatar or \[Remove\] to
switch your user back to the default image.

Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can click \[Update User\]
to commit the changes.

## Change Password

If you click on the "Change Password" button you can update your
password

You need to enter the old password and the new password twice. Assuming
that the old password matches your current password and that the two
instances of the new password match, the system will change your
password.

## Organizations

Customers may be assigned to an organization. Refer to the
Administration Document on how to create and add users to organizations.

When part of an organization, the user may be in one of three roles:

-   **Member** -- This user can view company information, users in his
organization that have accounts in the application, and view open
tickets by other organization members.

-   **Supervisor** -- This user can do all of the above, plus edit any
of the open tickets.

-   **Manager** -- This user can do all of the above, as well as remove
user accounts from the organization and add new users, and modify
organization properties.
