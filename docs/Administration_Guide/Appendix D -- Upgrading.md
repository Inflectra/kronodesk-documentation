# Appendix D -- Upgrading

This section covers any important notes regarding differences between
versions, and anything the Administrator or application owner may need
to address upon upgrading. These are note release notes, but important
changes in the application that may cause undesired application behavior
when upgrading.

## Version 1.x to 2.0:

The upgrade between these two versions is very major. Except for
existing data (tickets, users, forum messages, etc.) the program manager
should treat this as a completely new application, and verify all
settings, configure the theme, and verify user security.

## Version 2.0 to 2.1:

Major differences in this release of the application are centered on
Organizations and user membership to organizations. There are a few page
changes that should be addressed:

1.  The Customer Home page (http://host/KronoDesk/External.aspx) has had
its text shifted around. When logged into the application as an
Administrator, you will be able to edit the text on this page by
using the 'Save' bookmarks over each editable area.

2.  The Email Verification
(http://host/KronoDesk/Account/VerificationRequired.aspx) and
Approval Required
(http://host/KronoDesk/Account/ApprovalRequired.aspx) pages are now
editable. The default text should work just fine, but you may wish
to change it.
