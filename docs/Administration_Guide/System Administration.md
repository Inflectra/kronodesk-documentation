# System Administration

Now that you have successfully installed KronoDesk<sup>®</sup>, this section of
the guide outlines how to perform the typical system-wide administrative
tasks necessary for setting up projects in the system, managing users
and verifying the license information. To perform these tasks, you need
to login to the system with a user that is a member of the
"Administrator" role. The special "administrator" login is created by
the installer for this very purpose. You should initially login to
KronoDesk® with the username administrator, and the
password PleaseChange. **It is recommend that this
password be changed as soon as possible** to something
that is secure yet memorable by clicking on the "User Profile" link --
see the KronoDesk® User Manual for more details.

Once you have logged in as an Administrator, you need to click the
"Administration" link in the main navigation bar. This will display the
Administration home page:

The page displays a list of the various administration settings pages
categorized by the part of the application they relate to. You can
expand and collapse the administration group by clicking on the green
header bar. By default, the administration home page will display the
System Settings \> General Settings page described in section 3.1.1
below. Each of the other administration settings pages is described
separately below.
