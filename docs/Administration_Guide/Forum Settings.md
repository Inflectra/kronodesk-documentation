## Categories & Forums

This page lets administrators manage the different categories and forums
used in the KronoDesk customer support forums. The customer forums are
divided up into categories and each category has a set of forums.
Typically the forum categories are associated with a particular product
or service, although there may be some general categories that are
product agnostic.
