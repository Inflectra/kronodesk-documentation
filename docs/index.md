KronoDesk® provides a knowledge base and online support forums, making your customers more self-sufficient with routine issues so that your support personnel can focus their time on the critical issues and complex enquiries.
This user manual outlines the features and functionality available in KronoDesk®, and demonstrates how to use the application to improve your customer satisfaction and optimize your customer support. For information on how to install and administer KronoDesk, please refer to the KronoDesk Administrative Guide. 

## Improve Customer Satisfaction
For your customers, KronoDesk® provides a single, easy to use destination for all their support needs. When they arrive with a problem, question or enquiry, KronoDesk will direct them to relevant knowledge base articles, suggest helpful discussion threads and provide self-service solutions so that they can find a wide range of immediate solutions and suggestions. 
For those enquiries that do not match an existing article or have not yet been discussed in a support forum, KronoDesk will direct the customer to log a help desk ticket.
The system provides an easy-to-use help desk submission form that gathers the appropriate information to ensure a speedy resolution of the problem. The customer can use their personalized dashboard to view the status of their help desk tickets and provide additional information as requested by the support agents.

## Optimize Customer Support
For your support agents, KronoDesk® eliminates the time and effort spent checking separate systems for help desk tickets, support requests and forum posts. Using the customizable agent dashboard, they can view all their assigned tickets, monitor incoming forum posts and check for new tickets all from the same screen. 
To reduce the time and effort spent dealing with routine enquiries, the agents can use KronoDesk to create knowledge base articles, FAQs, whitepapers and forum posts to document common problems and the possible solutions.
