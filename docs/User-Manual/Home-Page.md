# Home Page

When you first access KronoDeskÂ®, the system will default to displaying
either the Customer Home Page or the employee home page. The choice of
default home page depends on whether you are logged into the system and
if so, what role(s) your user belongs to. In either case, you can switch
from the Customer Home Page to the Employee Home Page by clicking the
link at the top of the page (assuming your user has permissions to see
the other page).

## Customer Home Page

When you first access the system without being logged-in, it will
display the public version of the customer home page illustrated below:

This version of the home page is neither personalized, nor customizable
and displays the following widgets:

-   **Support Overview** -- This widget walks you through the steps of
getting your support issue resolved. It provides a search box for
searching the online knowledge base, links to browse the support
forums and a message that you need to first log-in if you want to
submit a help desk ticket.

recent forum posts, including the name and date of the post.
Positioning the mouse over the title will display a popup tooltip
containing the long description of the post.

attempts, the system will lock your user account for ten (10) minutes.
This is to prevent brute-force attacks on the system.

hyperlink which will display the following dialog:

![](img/Home_Page_22.png)

challenge screen:

successfully enter the correct password answer, the system will generate
a new random password and email it to you.

If for any reason you do not receive an email with your new password,
you need to contact the administrator of your installation to have them
manually reset your password.
