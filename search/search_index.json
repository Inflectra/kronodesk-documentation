However a good first place to look for the cause is inside the Windows Event Viewer, which stores all errors raised in the system. To open the Event Viewer, click Start > Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer. This will open up the event viewer: Click on the Application and System folders in turn and look for errors raised by \"MSSQLSERVER\", \"KronoDesk\", \"DCOM\", \"ASPNET\" or \"IIS\". Click on the error message, and copy the text of the message into a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Before contacting Inflectra \u00ae customer support with the specific error message, here are a couple of common causes for the above errors together with the appropriate resolutions: The ASP.NET process account has been disabled Go to Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management and launch the Windows computer management console. Expand Local Users and Groups > Users and then double-click on the 'ASPNET' account. Make sure that the ASPNET user is not disabled. If you are using Windows 2003 or 2008 Server the ASPNET user is set per-application pool and typically is set to the built-in NETWORKSERVICE account, so this won't apply.

Missing MSDTC Issue \u00b6 There is one common error that has been found with installations where Microsoft SQL Server was installed after IIS was installed. This typically affects only Windows XP Professional, but could occur in other situations. What happens is that the SQL Server installation inadvertently removes the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) service from the system during the installation. To determine if this is indeed the cause of the observed error, you need to click on Start > Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Component Services: Once the window has opened, expand the folders marked \"Component Services\", \"Computers\", \"My Computer\" and \"COM+ Applications\" in turn. If the window opens correctly and displays the information illustrated above, then your IIS 500 error is being caused by something else. However if you receive an error message that indicates an inability to connect with the \"Distributed Transaction Coordinator\", then you have to fix the MSDTC service to enable IIS and ASP.NET to operate properly. To fix the issue, you need to make changes to the Windows System Registry (hereafter referred to as \"the registry\"). This is a process that should not be attempted by novice users, since any incorrect changes can complete wreck the Windows installation, requiring a complete reinstallation of the operating system. To open the registry, click Start > Run, and type \"Regedit.exe\" into the dialog box, and the registry will open: Expand the folders marked \"My Computer\", \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\", \"SOFTWARE\" and \"Microsoft\" in turn and navigate to the folder marked \"MSDTC\". Click the <Delete> button on your keyboard, and click <OK> on the confirmation box. Now close the registry editor. Now you need to click on Start >Settings > Control Panel > Add or Remove Programs and click on the tab marked \"Add/Remove Windows Components\": Don't change any of the selected components, but instead simply click the <Next> button. The Windows installer will detect that the MSDTC is missing (due to the registry change you made) and will now reinstall it correctly. Once this has finished, reboot the system and you should now be able to access ASP and ASP.NET applications from within IIS. Application Session Pooling Issues (Windows Vista, 7 or 2008) \u00b6 This issue can affect Windows Vista, 7 or Server 2008 using IIS 7.0. Since the 6.0 release of IIS, there is the ability to separate the web-server into different \"Application Pools\". Sometimes, web hosting companies will host multiple websites in the same application pool (which we do not recommend). When resources are maxed out for an application pool IIS 7 starts to recycle these sites causing application variables to be lost for those recycled sites. By default, KronoDesk installs on these operating systems in its own application pool . If you are experiencing application/session loss symptoms then we recommend asking your web hosting company to verify that your instance of KronoDesk is running in its own application pool with all recycling options disabled and the recycle worker process set to recycle only once during the day at a set time. To make these changes yourself, you need to follow these steps: Add new application pool for \"KronoDesk\" (if one does not already exist) and make sure it is set to use the .NET Framework v4.0 and the \"Integrated Pipeline\": Next, choose your own application pool in the KronoDesk web site properties:","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Appendix-A----Troubleshooting/#appendix-a-troubleshooting","text":"If you receive the dreaded \"IIS 500 Internal Error\" or the \"Server Application Not Available\" webpage when you try and access KronoDesk\u00ae for the first time, there can be a myriad of causes.

Custom Fields \u00b6 Tickets in the Help Desk system can have up to 20 custom fields. There are different types of custom fields allowed: Text : Normal or Rich-Text field. Integer : Whole-Number entry. Decimal : Fractional number entry (currency, etc.) Boolean : Simple yes/no (on/off) checkbox. Date : Date selector. List : Custom List selector. Multi-List : Custom List selector that allows multiple values. User : List of assignable users. Each custom field can have optional settings applied to it. Optional settings are as follows. (Note that not all settings are available for all field types.) Default : The default value when a new ticket is opened up. Precision : How many decimal places is allowed (or the value is rounded to). Minimum Value : The minimum value allowed. Maximum Value : The maximum value allowed. Minimum Length : The minimum length of the data required in the field. Maximum Length : The maximum length of the data allowed in the field. Rich Text : Whether or not the text field allows HTML or not. Custom List : The defined Custom List for the field that users can select from. Going to the main page, you will see a list of custom field defined for Tickets: To edit a definition, click the Edit Definition link on a field, and you will get a popup: The fields visible will vary depending on the type of custom field you have selected, but every custom field will need to have an Alias and a Type. The Alias is what is shown to the user when viewing or editing the ticket. The type is the type of data the ticket allows. Under the Options tab will be available options that can be set for the custom field. When finished, click the 'Save' button and you will be returned to the Custom Field list. Important Note: When changing a custom field's type or removing a field, the data is not actually removed from the ticket. Therefore, if you change a custom field of a date into a text, the field will display the old date value until it is changed by the user. Ticket Statuses \u00b6 Ticket statuses can be edited using the grid that displays all defined statuses. All statuses must have a display name, which is viewed by the user editing or viewing the ticket. The other fields are: Closed for Internal? - Whether this status is considered as inactive for internal users (employees, support agents, etc.). For example the sample status 'Waiting on Customer' would be considered 'Closed for Internal' because customer support agents do not want to see such tickets in their list when it's waiting for a customer to respond. Closed for External - Whether this status is considered as inactive for external users (customers, etc.). For example the sample status 'Waiting on Customer' would be considered 'Open for External' because end users / customers would definitely want to see such tickets in their list since the support agent is waiting for their response. Default? - The status selected as the default is the status that new tickets are opened as. To add a new Status, click the Add New Status link -- a new row will be inserted into the table where you can save the new status. To remove a status, click the Remove link. Any tickets with a status that has been removed will stay that status, until the next time a user edits the ticket. In addition to this screen that lets you edit the ticket statuses, if you click on the \"Advanced\" option in the left hand navigation, it will bring up the screen that lets you specify some additional status change rules: There are several options you can configure: The Default Open Status -- this allows you to specify the status that a ticket will be automatically switched to when a new note is added by the person who originally opened the ticket. This is useful when a customer accesses one of their existing tickets that's in a closed status but forgets to change the status back to an open status. This ensures that such tickets do not get forgotten about. The Default Assigned Status -- this allows you to specify the status that a ticket will be automatically switched to when you use the bulk assign tools on the main Help Desk page. For example five new tickets arrive and you select them and choose the option to \"Assign Tickets to Me\". When they are assigned in this way, the system will automatically change their status to the default assigned status option (if specified). Closed Status -- After a set amount of time, an open ticket can be automatically closed. This will only happen if a ticket is set to a status that is not open for internal (customer service), but is open externally (for customers). The dropdown list contains the status that the ticket will be switched to. Age of Ticket - Allowable values: 7-365. After the ticket is this number of days old, the status will be automatically closed. Ticket Types \u00b6 The Ticket Type page defines values allowed for the standard Type field for tickets. Types must have a unique display name, which is what the user sees when they view or edit a type. To add a new type, click the Add New Type link, and fill out the new empty row. To remove a type, click the Remove button to the right of the defined type. Note that any tickets assigned to a type that is removed will retain their type, until the next time a user tries to edit the ticket. Ticket Priorities \u00b6 The Ticket Priorities page defines values allowed for the standard Priority field. Like types, priorities must have a unique name. To add a new priority, click the Add New Priority link, and fill out the new empty row. To remove a priority, click the Remove button to the right of the priority. Note that any tickets assigned to a priority that is removed will retain their value, until the next time a user tries to edit the ticket. Colors assigned to the priority will appear in the Ticket List page in the Priority column. Ticket Resolutions \u00b6 The Ticket Resolutions page defines values allowed for the standard Resolution field. Like types and priorities, resolutions must have a unique name. The description is used internally, and should just contain a short summary of the meaning of the resolution. To add a new resolution, click the Add New Resolution link, and fill out the new empty row. To remove a resolution, click the Remove button to the right of the resolution. Note that any tickets assigned to a resolution that is removed will retain their value, until the next time a user tries to edit the ticket. Spira Integration \u00b6 When customer support agents work on tickets received from customers, they may find that the issue is actually a product defect rather than a customer support matter. In which case, they can take advantage of the built-in integration with SpiraTeam \u00ae - Inflectra's award winning Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) solution that has a powerful product incident management system. KronoDesk\u00ae has the ability to connect to an instance of SpiraTeam\u00ae and add new product incidents into the system that are linked to the originating KronoDesk Ticket. That allows customer service agents to monitor the status of the associated product incidents and inform customers when the appropriate patches or fixes are available to correct the problem. This screen allows the administrator to setup the connection between SpiraTeam and KronoDesk. You should enter the URL that your users use to access their instance of SpiraTest, SpiraPlan or SpiraTeam (including the HTTP or HTTPS prefix) together with the SpiraTeam login and RSS Token for a valid SpiraTeam user. The login and associated RSS Token is used to verify the connection. Once you have entered the information, you should click the [Test] button to verify that the URL is accessible. If there are connectivity issues, and error will be displayed, otherwise a green confirmation message will appear. Once the connection information has been successfully verified, you need to click the [Save] button to save the connection settings in the system. Ticket Article Templates: \u00b6 Templates can be created for quick replies to support tickets. This allows for support agents to quickly respond to support tickets referencing a related KB Article. You can edit or create a new template, and to reference the selected KB Article, you can use a set of templates, available in the ( [T] ) toolbar button. The support agent can then select one of these templates on the Ticket Details page, along with a KB article to insert into the agent's reply.","title":"Help Desk Settings"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Help-Desk-Settings/#help-desk-settings","text":"This section contains all of the settings that affect the help desk ticketing part of the application.","title":"Help Desk Settings"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Help-Desk-Settings/#custom-fields","text":"Tickets in the Help Desk system can have up to 20 custom fields.

However, Windows workstation editions can only support a maximum of 5 concurrent user web sessions. In general, unless there are only going to be a couple of client machines hitting the server, we recommend using Windows Server. System Prerequisites \u00b6 Assuming that you have already installed the appropriate version of Microsoft Windows onto your computer (or that has been pre-installed for you), make sure that the various prerequisites have been correctly added to your installation before trying to install KronoDesk \u00ae . The KronoDesk \u00ae installer will check to ensure that the various prerequisites are in place, and will abort the installation if any are missing, indicating to you what action needs to be taken. We recommend that you install / configure the prerequisites in the following order: Install the .NET Framework v4.6 Install SQL Server 2017, 2016, 2014, 2012 Install a modern web browser like Microsoft Edge Ensure that IIS is installed Ensure that ASP.NET 4.6 is enabled Install the .NET Framework v4.6, v4.7 \u00b6 On most modern Windows 10 and Windows Server installations, Microsoft .NET Framework v4.6 is usually installed as part of the factory configuration, whereas on earlier operating systems, you might need to manually add the .NET 4.6 components to the factory configuration. To see which version of the Microsoft .NET framework installed, open up Windows Explorer\u00ae and navigate to C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework and then the subfolders listed will indicate which version(s) of the framework you have installed: To install the .NET Framework, launch your browser and enter the URL: https://www.inflectra.com/CustomerArea . Once you have logged-in to the customer area, under the \"My Downloads\" section there will be hyperlinks to download and install the appropriate version of the .NET Framework (version 4.6 at time of writing). Click on the option to download and install the .NET Framework, and follow the instructions provided. Once you have completed the install, verify that the installation was successful by looking in the \"Administrative Tools\" folder as illustrated above. You also need to make sure that .NET 4.6 has been installed if necessary. Install SQL Server 2019, 2017, 2016, 2014, 2012 \u00b6 If you do not have a SQL Server instance ready, you can install the appropriate version of the database software, following the instructions provided with the installation. We recommend SQL Server Express Edition\u00ae for most users. This free version of SQL Server will offer sufficient performance for most installations and can be easily downloaded from either the customer area of our website ( http://www.inflectra.com/CustomerArea ) or directly from the Microsoft\u00ae web-site at http://www.microsoft.com/express/sql . Ensure that IIS is installed \u00b6 On Windows Server OS installations, IIS is usually installed as part of the factory configuration, whereas on Windows workstation OS installations, you typically need to manually add the components to the factory configuration. The steps that you need to take to verify its installation are listed below: To check if you have IIS installed, click Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools. Under the \"Administrative Tools folder\", you should see an icon for \"Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager\". If you don't see this icon, then it means that you need to add IIS to your computer: Windows 8, Windows 8.1 \u00b6 On Windows 8 or 8.1 , to install IIS, you need to click Start > Control Panel > Programs and Features, then choose the option to \"Turn Windows features on or off\". This will bring up the list of features and roles that can be configured on the server: Windows 10 \u00b6 On Windows 10 , to install IIS, you need to click Start > Control Panel > Programs and Features, then choose the option to \"Turn Windows features on or off\". This will bring up the list of features and roles that can be configured on the server: Make sure that the following features are enabled within the 'Internet Information Services' folder: Web Management Tools IIS 6 Management Compatibility IIS Management Console IIS Management Service World Wide Web Services Application Development Features .NET Extensibility 3.5 .NET Extensibility 4.8 ASP.NET 3.5 ASP.NET 4.8 ISAPI Extensions ISAPI Filters Common HTTP Features Default Document Directory Browsing HTTP Errors HTTP Redirection Static Content In the same panel ('Turn Windows Features on or off') you also need to check that the following features are enabled in the '.NET Framework 4.6 Advanced Services' folder: .NET Framework 4.6 Advanced Services ASP.NET 4.6 WCF Services HTTP Activation TCP Port Sharing To verify that this IIS is now installed, type \" http://localhost \" into the browser's address bar. You should see a screen displaying the initial IIS startup page: Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019 \u00b6 On Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019 , you need to click on Server Manager, then under the \"Roles\" heading, choose the option to \"Add Role\" followed by selecting the new role \"Web Server / IIS\". Then click \"Next\" to bring up the role configuration screen: Make sure that the following features are enabled: Web Server (IIS) Web Server Common HTTP Features Default Document Directory Browsing HTTP Errors Static Content HTTP Redirection Application Development .NET Extensibility 3.5 .NET Extensibility 4.5 ASP.NET 3.5 ASP.NET 4.5 ISAPI Extensions ISAPI Filters Management Tools IIS Management Console IIS Management Service .NET Framework 4.5 Features .NET Framework 4.5 ASP.NET 4.5 WCF Services HTTP Activation TCP Port Sharing Ensure that ASP.NET is installed \u00b6 Once IIS and .NET are both installed, make sure the Active Server Pages (ASP.NET) components that allow IIS to access the .NET framework are correctly configured. If you installed .NET after IIS, then ASP.NET is typically configured for you. But if you installed IIS afterwards, then further manual steps may be necessary. To verify that ASP.NET has been correctly configured, click on Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager to launch the IIS administrative console: You should see a section called \"ASP.NET\" occupying the top third of the IIS screen. If not, then you need to go back to Ensure that ASP.NET is installed and make sure that you chose the option to install ASP.NET when installing IIS. Installing the Software \u00b6 Once all of the prerequisites are correctly installed, you are now ready to install KronoDesk \u00ae . To perform the installation you will need the items listed below (all of which are available in the customer area of the Inflectra \u00ae website): the installation package the name of the organization the software is licensed to the license key code To start the installation, double-click on the KronoDesk \u00ae installation package (it will have a filename in the form of KronoDesk-vX.X.X.exe). The Installer will display the following dialog box: Select an Installation Type \u00b6 Click the \"Next\" button to start the installation wizard. The wizard will gather information about what you want to do and how you want to do it. Before any changes are made to your system (installing web-server files and database components) you will get a chance to review everything again. Review the License Agreement and Prerequisites \u00b6 The next screen provides a copy of the KronoDesk \u00ae End User License Agreement (EULA). Please read this carefully as it describes the legal contract between you -- the user of the software -- and Inflectra \u00ae Corporation, the developer and publisher. Once you have read the agreement and understood your rights and obligations, select the radio button marked \"I accept the terms in the License Agreement\" and click the \"Next\" button. The next page of the wizard will display a list of the required pre-requisites and whether the installer could find them or not. The checks here are not fool-proof (in particular where a question mark is shown) so it is recommended to manually check the prerequisites in full as described above. The system will not require all prerequisites to be met before allowing the installation, but the application may display incorrectly if any are missing. License Information \u00b6 The next stage of the wizard is to enter license information: You need to enter: the organization that was issued the software license the full license key for the relevant version of the software The installer will verify the license information as you enter it. If the details entered are valid then the information will be displayed beneath the entry fields. This allows you to check that the correct application and license will be installed. On clicking Next, the installer will warn you of any discrepancies, and will not allow you to proceed until valid information has been provided. If for any reason you are unable to get the provided license key to work, please contact Inflectra \u00ae customer support for help resolving the issue. Choose an Installation Location (advanced mode only) \u00b6 If you checked \"advanced\" at the start of the installation process, you will have the option to choose where the application is installed. You can choose an existing folder or make a new one and select that. By default it is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[Application Name]). Web Server Configuration \u00b6 Choose which web site to install KronoDesk \u00ae into using the available dropdown, which should list all available web sites in IIS on this machine. The Default Web Site will be preselected and is the best option in most circumstances. Virtual Directory (advanced mode only) If installing in advanced mode, then on this screen you will able to change the name of the web-site URL that will be used to access the system. By default, users would need to type into their browsers: http://\"server name\"/[product name]. Should you want to have a different name change the name in the Virtual Directory box, otherwise simply accept the default name and click \"Next\". Note: The installer will check to make sure that the name you have chosen is not already in use, and will warn you if it is. Connect to the Database \u00b6 KronoDesk \u00ae has an application (installed into a default folder on your system), a website (configured above), and a database. The next screen tells the installer how to connect to the database server on your system. a) Windows Authentication This is the easiest option when the application and database will be residing on the same server. It is the only option available for authentication during a standard installation. In this case, choose the \"Windows Authentication\" option and the Login/Password boxes will be disabled. In this case, the installer will connect to the database using your current Windows login to create the application database objects, and KronoDesk \u00ae will connect to the database during normal operation using either the ASPNET or NETWORK SERVICE Windows accounts (it depends on the version of the operating system). b) SQL Server Authentication (advanced mode only) This is the easiest option when the application and databases will be residing on different servers across the network. In this case, choose \"SQL Server Authentication\" and provide a SQL Server Login that has full sysadmin permissions -- e.g. the built in System Administrator (SA) account. The installer will use this sysadmin account to create the database objects, and KronoDesk \u00ae will use a special login (called \"KronoDesk\" by default) for normal application operations. Setting the Correct Server Instance In the \"Server\" box, you need to enter the name of the Microsoft SQL Server instance that is running on your system; the installer will default it to the hostname of the server (which in many cases will be correct). The easiest way to find out the database server name is to open up the SQL Server Administrative console (typically by clicking Start > Programs > Microsoft SQL Server > Enterprise Manager) and look for the name of the server. For SQL Server Express edition installations, the Server name is usually the name of your computer followed by \"\\SQLEXPRESS\", so for example, if your computer is called MyComputer, the server name would be MyComputer\\SQLEXPRESS. Omitting the second part (called the instance name) would lead to a \"host not found\" error. You can also choose whether to install the sample products or not - typically we recommend installing the sample products for evaluation installations and excluding them for production installs. Complete the Installation \u00b6 Once you have entered the various pieces of information, click \"Next\". The installer will attempt to connect to the database using the provided information, and it will display an error message if any of the information is incorrect. Assuming the information is correct, the following screen will be displayed: Once you have confirmed that everything is correct, click the \"Install\" button to actually begin the process of installing KronoDesk \u00ae onto your system. The installer will then display a progress bar as the installation proceeds. Once the installation is complete, the installer will provide confirmation, or display information about any problems it encountered. Click the \"Finish\" button to complete the installation. Congratulations! You have successfully installed KronoDesk \u00ae onto your system. If you type http://localhost/KronoDesk into your browser you should see the KronoDesk \u00ae login page. If for any reason you don't see the login page, please contact Inflectra \u00ae support team . Upgrading \u00b6 You can upgrade any KronoDesk \u00ae version that is 3.0.6 or newer using our v4 installer. To upgrade an existing installation: download the latest version of the installer exe application from your customer area run the installer on the machine the application is on on the Installation Type screen, select the \"Upgrade\" button and follow the steps below Review the License Agreement and Prerequisites \u00b6 The next screen provides a copy of the KronoDesk \u00ae End User License Agreement (EULA). Please read this carefully as it describes the legal contract between you -- the user of the software -- and Inflectra \u00ae Corporation, the developer and publisher. Once you have read the agreement and understood your rights and obligations, select the radio button marked \"I accept the terms in the License Agreement\" and click the \"Next\" button. The next page of the wizard will display a list of the required pre-requisites and whether the installer could find them or not. The checks here are not fool-proof (in particular where a question mark is shown) so it is recommended to manually check the prerequisites in full as described above. The system will not require all prerequisites to be met before allowing the installation, but the application may display incorrectly if any are missing. License Information \u00b6 The next stage of the wizard is to enter license information: You need to enter: the organization that was issued the software license the full license key for the relevant version of the software The installer will verify the license information as you enter it. If the details entered are valid then the information will be displayed beneath the entry fields. This allows you to check that the correct application and license will be installed. On clicking Next, the installer will warn you of any discrepancies, and will not allow you to proceed until valid information has been provided. If for any reason you are unable to get the provided license key to work, please contact Inflectra \u00ae customer support for help resolving the issue. Upgrade location \u00b6 The installer will default to the default installation location for the licensed version. If this is not correct, click the folder icon to select the proper installation location. After verifying the location, the installer will display the screen that shows the summary of actions to be performed. Confirm to proceed with the upgrade. Just in case of problems, a backup of the existing database is made when upgrading. The location is given on the summary screen, and is usually the default backup directory for SQL Server. To recover your system, restore the backup over top of the existing corrupted database. You can then try the upgrade again. If problems persist, contact the support department, and they will explain how to retrieve the logs for remediation. Advanced Install Scenarios \u00b6 There may be a few cases where you need to customize the installation or upgrade of KronoDesk \u00ae . To enable the installer's advanced mode, make sure to check the \"Advanced\" checkbox at the relevant screen of the wizard. Including the options listed above with \"(advanced mode only)\" next to them, Advanced mode lets you: Choose an installation location during installs Specify the virtual directory during installs Use SQL Server Authentication instead of Windows authentication Adding a new application server in a cluster of load-balanced servers (explained below) Upgrading a database to the current release (explained below) Adding An Application Server \u00b6 Use this option when you already have another application server and database server configured and operational. Installation is very similar to a standard installation normally. However, when the page about the SQL Server and Database is displayed, it requires you to point to the existing SQL Server and Database. All other actions during this install matches those in a standard installation . Upgrading an existing Database \u00b6 Use this option in two rare cases: where an application was upgraded but the installer did not upgrade the database if so instructed by the Inflectra support team These steps in this option are the same as if you were upgrading the application normally . You will be asked for the SQL Server and Database information for your database. Once the installer connects and verifies the version of the database to be installed, you will be prompted with an additional Options screen with two options: Database Backup Options : will let you reconfigure whether and where a backup of the database is created. Stop IIS Process : will stop the IIS process during upgrade. In some cases this may be necessary in case IIS has a lock on the database that prevents it from being modified. Security Considerations \u00b6 The Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web-server and SQL Server database are powerful tools to managing web-based applications. However it is important to make sure that they are correctly secured to prevent unauthorized access to applications being hosted on them. This is a fast-changing field and beyond the scope of this guide to address, however we recommend reading the following article for details on how to secure IIS: http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/configuring-security In addition to the steps outlined in this article, it is important to note that by default, all web pages served by IIS using the HTTP protocol are unencrypted, and as such, the usernames and passwords used by KronoDesk \u00ae to log into the application can be read by network sniffing tools. If you are using KronoDesk \u00ae purely within an intranet environment, this may not be an issue. However, if you are externally hosting KronoDesk \u00ae onto a publicly accessible website, we recommend installing a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption certificate, and restricting all web-traffic to the secure HTTPS protocol instead. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Every time the installer attempts an operation (like an install or upgrade), it stores a log file. This is located at \"c:\\ProgramData\\Inflectra\\KronoDesk\". Each log file is labelled with the date and time of the operation. Please share the relevant files with the Inflectra support team if you need help troubleshooting the required operation.","title":"Installing KronoDesk"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Installing-KronoDesk/#installing-kronodesk","text":"This section outlines how to: prepare your system for installation of KronoDesk \u00ae install the software ensure that your web-server is correctly configured to ensure secure operation","title":"Installing KronoDesk\u00ae"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Installing-KronoDesk/#hardware-and-software-requirements","text":"The minimum hardware and software requirements for running the KronoDesk \u00ae system are: Server Requirements Requirement Minimum Specification Processor: Intel\u00ae or AMD\u00ae x86 or x64 compatible processor Memory: 4 GB, 8 GB recommended Operating System: Windows Server 2019 (recommended) Windows Server 2016 (recommended) Windows Server 2012 R1 & R2 Windows 10, 8 (for demoing) Database: Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Express Edition Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Express Edition Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Express Edition Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express Edition Web Server: Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 or higher ASP.NET Web Extensions 4.6 or higher Client Requirements Web Browser: Microsoft Edge Mozilla Firefox Google Chrome (Desktop and Android) Apple Safari (Desktop and iOS) Opera Other Components: Microsoft Excel 2010+ (optional) Microsoft Word 2010+ (optional) Microsoft Project 2010+ (optional) *Note that KronoDesk \u00ae can be loaded onto either Windows Server or workstation editions, provided that the IIS web-server is installed and that SQL Server is available as a database engine.

The only exception is that the settings related to authentication and user management are in their own separate group \"User Settings\". General Settings \u00b6 The General Settings page is used to set the general application-wide settings that affect the overall application and are used to ensure that the application matches your environment. In the current version, you can specify the default language, specify the base URL, configure the folder used to store document attachments and also specify whether certain parts of the application should require a secure connection. This page lets you specify the following values: Default Culture - KronoDesk can display information in a variety of different languages (assuming that the appropriate language packs have been installed) and number formats. By default, KronoDesk will use the regional settings (language and number formats) of the operating system it has been installed on. However, you can override this default by choosing the appropriate culture from the list of options displayed in the drop-down list. Note: The list of culture options does not reflect the available language packs, so in some cases, the setting will only change the number formats. Default Time Zone - KronoDesk stores all dates and times internally in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and can therefore display dates/times adjusted for different time zones. By default, KronoDesk will display dates in the time zone specified in the operating system it has been installed on. However, you can override this default by choosing the appropriate display time zone from the list of options displayed in the drop-down list. Attachments Folder - By default when KronoDesk is installed, the document attachments uploaded in the system get stored inside the C:\\Program Files\\KronoDesk\\Attachments folder located inside the main KronoDesk installation root. However you may want to have the documents stored on a remotely mounted drive or on a different hard disk partition. In which case you can simply change the folder pointed to in the text-box illustrated above and then click [Save] to commit the change. When changing the directory, be sure to move any existing attachment files to the new location, and verify that the IIS User has read and write access to the directory. Application Base URL - This is the URL that your users use to access the system. Do not put the /Login.aspx or any other page here, as this URL is used to generate links to different pages in the application. This setting is primarily used in email notifications and RSS feeds to specify the URL of the application. Require SSL -- When this is selected, the application will require a secure connection when accessing the Account Profile pages. This is useful if you want to run the site using an unencrypted connection (to maximize performance) but want to require a secure connection for the login pages where a user will have to enter a password. Using this option requires that you have a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate installed on your web server. Use SQL Free Text -- If possible, when running searches and queries, have the application use SQL's Free Text indexing to speed up result pages to users. Note that enabling Free Text Indexing will require higher minimum system requirements for the SQL Server. Allowed Domains -- This is used when accessing the KronoDesk REST API from another web page using a Cross Origin Request Sharing (CORS) based REST request. In KronoDesk you need to specify the allowed domains (or * for all) which are allowed to make sure a request. Authoritative Domain/Protocol -- In case where multiple domains point to the same installation (i.e. www.kronodest.net and kronodest.net), any access to the application will redirect to the domain and protocol entered here. Enabled Sections \u00b6 This section allows you to activate and deactivate different parts of the application (for example you might not want to initially make the support forums available to customers). Changes take effect immediately, and no data is lost. You can enable the sections at a later date, and still have all of your information from earlier. You are still able to adjust settings for a disabled section in Administration, but none of the changes will be visible until the section is re-enabled. Appearance \u00b6 The Appearance page is used to customize the information displayed in KronoDesk and edit the colors and theme of the application. Theme Tab \u00b6 The first tab lets you select a pre-generated theme to use or create a new theme or edit an existing theme. On this tab, you can select and 'Apply' the theme you want to use for the application. Or, if you select 'Edit Selected Theme' or 'Create New Theme', you will be taken to the theme edit window: By selecting the colors in the selection boxes, the live preview window will update to show how the actual application will work, using a sample page. Once you have your design configured, click the 'Save' button to return to the theme selection. Then, click the 'Apply Theme' button to apply the designed theme to the whole application. Do not set all colors to the same value! Your users will not be able to navigate the site. Branding Tab \u00b6 This tab is where you can specify static information relating to your company, external links and other fixed-page items. This page lets you specify the following values: Images: Company Logo -- This is the image that is displayed in the top left corner of the navigation bar, on wider devices. (Desktops, tablets in landscape mode, etc.) Mobile Logo -- This is the image that is used in the top left corner on smaller devices. Company Information: Company Name -- This field is used to change the name of the company that is displayed in the application footer Copyright Year -- This field is used to change the copyright year to match the starting year of your company's website copyright. Contact Phone Number -- This field is used to specify the phone number that should be displayed on the application footer Email Address -- this field is used to specify the email address displayed on various pages within the application. We recommend that you set this to match your primary support email address (e.g. support@mycompany.com or info@mycompany.com ). RSS Feed -- The application home page will display a list of recent news headlines from your company's newsfeed. To enable this functionality, simply enter the URL for your company's RSS newsfeed into this text box and it will automatically enable the home page widget and tell it to display news items from your newsfeed. Title Prefix -- All of the web pages in KronoDesk prefix the title of the page with the application name (e.g. \"KronoDesk | Help Desk\" or \"KronoDesk | Support Forums\"). This setting allows you to choose the text displayed in the prefix. We recommend we set it to your company's name. That way, web pages will be displayed using this name (e.g. \"MyCompany | Help Desk\"). Hyperlinks: Header Icon Link -- This is the URL to take the user to when they click the company logo. Useful Link #1 - #3 -- These are the names (text) and the URLs to display to the user. These can be used in Email templates for notifications going out to users, and are displayed on the customer's home page. Footer Link #1 - #3 -- These are the names (text) and the URLs to display to the user. These are displayed in the footer of the application. Page Texts: This is a list of links to pages that have inline editors to edit and adjust how the pages look to users viewing the pages. Page Javascript: This allows the administrator to add some script to execute on every page. All pages will run the Javascript entered here, except for Administration pages. This would be used to enter in Analytics trackers or other SEO or ROI tracking code. Email Configuration \u00b6 This section allows you to change the settings regarding how KronoDesk sends out email notifications. There are several tabs that you contain different settings: Email Options \u00b6 This tab allows you to change some of the basic high-level email settings: The options are: Allow Outgoing Emails: Turning this off will disable ALL outgoing emails. Note that with this off, the email importer cannot be used, as users created via the importer will not be able to verify their account. Send User Welcome Email: When this is enabled, a new registered user will receive a welcome email. Notify Admin of New User: When enabled, the administrator account will be sent an email notifying of a new user registration. From Email Address: On outgoing emails, this name and address is the email account the email will come from. Reply-To Email Address: On outgoing emails, this name and address will be in the 'Reply-To' header of the email. Force Email Control?: This setting lets the users define their own email options. If enabled, then users will not be able to disable receiving emails from the application. If disabled, they will be able to turn off email notifications. Send Email Separator: Recommended if using the Email Importer for importing support tickets from an email account. Enabling this will add a line that will help the Importer keep reply text as minimal as possible. SMTP Server \u00b6 This page allows for setting up KronoDesk to communicate with your SMTP Server. The fields available and their usage are: The options are: Use IIS Mail Server Settings : If set to 'No', you must define your SMTP server information below. If set to 'Yes', the application will use the defined IIS virtual server settings. SMTP Server Hostname / Port : The DNS or IP address of the SMTP server, and the port that it accepts incoming mail on. Use SSL Connection : Whether or not the SMTP server requires an SSL connection. SMTP Server UserID / Password : The username or password to log onto the SMTP server with. If no username or password is required, enter in 'anonymous' in both fields. Mail Templates \u00b6 This tab allows you to customize the email templates that are sent out: To modify a template, you need to select which template you wish to edit. Once you select the template, the page will reload and display the selected template. The subject line is used in all emails sent with this template -- note that some templates do not have a subject defined, and in this case the field will be hidden. With this editor, you can link to external images, but cannot send any images as attachments. You can modify the template to make it match your company's styles, adding colors and fonts as needed. Outgoing data uses a Token system. You can select a token to insert using the Token button in the toolbar of the rich text editor ( [T] ). It will open a dialog letting you select the token to insert. Available templates to edit are: User: New User Registration : If the 'Send new user welcome email' setting is set to true, this email template is sent out when a user registers. User: Forgot Password : When the user forgets their password. Forums: Subscription : Sent when there is an update to a forum that the user is subscribed to. KB: Subscription : Send when there is an update to a Knowledge Base Article that the user is subscribed to. User: Inactive Account Created : Sent out when a user had an account created for them via the Email Importer application. Contains information on how the user can verify their account to be able to log into the website. Ticket: Notification : Sent out when a notification event is fired off due to a ticket update. This is the master template -- the template can be edited per notification event when the event is created. Custom Lists \u00b6 Custom Lists at this time are used in Custom Field definitions. The main custom property list screen lists all available lists available for assignment to a custom field. The table shows all defined custom lists and their information. The Custom List ID, the name of the list, how many selectable options it has, and then actions you can perform on the list -- Edit the Values, Remove (delete) the list, or add a new list. Lists must have a unique name. When creating or editing a list, the following screen is displayed: The list name and description are for identification purposes only, and are not visible to other users in the application. Each list item must have a unique name, if you try to add a duplicate or empty value, an error will be thrown. Click the 'Save' button to save your values, and use the link at top to return to the main Custom List page. Product Definitions \u00b6 Products are used throughout the system in various ways. For tickets and in the knowledge base, they are used to classify and for organization, and to help the user find information they need to help them. The screen for editing and creating products is: The fields are used as follows: Token : Not used at this time, however, each product must have a unique token ID. Display Name : This is what the product will display to users when selecting or researching a product. Description : This is a short description for internal use to describe the product. Workflow : This is the selected workflow for Tickets assigned to this product. See Workflows . License Details \u00b6 The license details page displays the information about the installed license for the particular instance of KronoDesk\u00ae being used. The information displayed includes: the product name, the license version (e.g. v2.0.0.0), type of license in effect (x-user fixed, x-user concurrent, demonstration, enterprise, etc.), the organization that the license belongs to, the actual license key code and finally the number of agent-users concurrently logged-in. This last piece of information is useful as it helps administrators track down how many agent licenses are being used. A sample page is illustrated below: To change the license key used by the system (for example, if to upgrade from Trial edition to Standard edition), you do not need to reinstall KronoDesk. All you need to do is simply change the information in the organization and license key text-boxes to match the license key and organization name found in the customer area of our website ( http://www.inflectra.com/CustomerArea ) and click the <Update> button. If there is an issue with the license key (e.g. a trial version that is passed its expiration date, or where the license key doesn't match the organization name) an error will be displayed describing the specific issue with the information you entered. If you are unable to get the system to work with the license key information, please contact Inflectra \u00ae customer support at: support@inflectra.com . Event Log \u00b6 The \"System Event Log\" administration page lets you view all of the errors, warning and other diagnostic messages that have been logged in the system: Each event entry is displayed along with the date-time it occurred, the type of event (error, warning, information, success audit, failure audit), category (application, source code provider, data-synchronization) and the short name. To view the full details of the error or warning, click on the \"View Item\" button: The popup dialog box will display the full error message log and stack trace in a moveable dialog box. This information should be provided to Inflectra customer support if you log a help desk ticket. Remove Sample Data \u00b6 This administration link is only available while the system still has sample data in it. This administration option will remove all data that was added in at installation, with the following guidelines: Users : All users between ID 2 and ID 11 will be removed. The main Administrator account, and any users created after installation will remain. User Organizations : The two sample organizations will be removed. Tickets : All tickets created at installation will remain, except for the first 28 tickets which were installed Ticket Statuses, Priorities, Resolutions, and Types : All these will be removed, unless any are used in tickets that were created after installation. Custom Property : All custom property definitions for Tickets will be removed. Attachments : All attachments created at installation will be removed. Articles : Articles 1 to 28 will be removed. Products : All predefined products will be removed, unless they are in use by any tickets not removed. Categories : Categories 1 through 4 will be removed, including all forums and threads contained therein, even if they were added after installation. This can only be run once, and cannot be undone without reinstalling the entire application, so please use with caution! Some sample data will remain, depending on what data was added before the remove action was run. Depending on the data, there may be some foreign links in the database that will prevent some sample data from being removed. Orphaned Documents: \u00b6 In some occasions, there can be attachments stored on the system that are not deleted when their associated item is deleted. This can cause unused files to fill up the attachments storange directory. This page will show the administrator any attachments in the database that have no associated link to a ticket or KB article, or documents on the file server with no record in the database: By clicking the 'Purge' button, the system will be cleaned of all unused files and unlinked attachments.","title":"System Settings"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/System-Settings/#system-settings","text":"This section contains all of the application-wide settings that affect the entire system, rather than a specific module.

Currently it allows an administrator to view the list of users and modify a user's profile as well as see a list of active sessions. User Security \u00b6 This page shows options for configuring user registration and login options. By adjusting the settings here, it is possible to require all users to verify email addresses, turn off new-user registration completely, and require administrator approval of all new users: Available options are: Allow New Users to Register : When disabled, new user creation will not be possible, except by an administrator. Require Email Verification : Sets whether users must verify their email addresses before they will be allowed to log into the system. They will still be able to access the site as a guest, however. Require Admin Approval : Sets whether all new accounts created will need to be verified by an administrator account. Default Role : When a new user registers to access your instance of KronoDesk you have an option of assigning them a default role in the system. Require Captcha on Registration : Sets whether the user must pass a bot/robot check while creating a new account. Site / Secret Key : Required for the ReCaptcha validation. These are issued by Google ( http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin ), and must be entered in for the bot-check to activate. Maximum # Invalid Password Attempts : Set this to the number of times a user can enter an incorrect password before their account is temporarily locked out. This is important in preventing 'brute force' password hacking attempts. Minimum Required Password Length : Set this to the minimum length of passwords in the system. Choosing a longer password will make it harder for an unauthorized user to crack a password and gain entry into the system. Minimum Required Special Characters - Set this to the minimum number of non-alphanumeric characters that will be required for passwords in the system. Choosing more required special characters will make it harder for an unauthorized user to crack a password and gain entry into the system. Password Attempt Time Window : Set this to the duration (in minutes) after which a user's account will be automatically unlocked (due to repeated incorrect password attempts). Authentication Expiration : This specifies the amount of time (in minutes) after which a user will be logged out due to inactivity when they login without choosing the 'Remember Me' option. Keep Me Logged-In Expiration - This specifies the amount of time (in minutes) after which a user will be logged out due to inactivity if they have chosen to login with the 'Keep Me Logged-In' option. This should normally be longer than the previous setting. Manage Users \u00b6 This page will display a list of all the users (both active and inactive) currently in the system: The users are listed with their name, login, email address, active status, approved status, whether they are currently locked out (for incorrectly entering their password too many times), the date they last logged-in and their user id. You can sort or filter the user list by entering the text in the search box. To view the details of a specific user, simply click on their name which is a hyperlink. If LDAP is enabled and configured to allow the importing of users, a button called \"Import from LDAP Server\" will display below the list of users. Click this button to start Importing LDAP Users . User Profile Page \u00b6 You can update the following fields on this page: login ID : the user's login ID. This has to be unique. Email Address : a valid email address that notifications will be sent to. This has to be unique. First Name : the user's first name Middle Initial : the user's middle initial (if applicable) Last Name : the user's last name Comment : Used for Admin purposes only, the user does not see this on his own account. Culture/Locale : By default all profiles will be set to use the application's default culture. This means that the language and number formats used in the application will be the ones decided by the person who installed the system. However there are cases where you want to use a different language or number format (for example, a German employee working in the German office of a French company might want to use the German culture instead of French). You can change the culture to any of the options listed in the dropdown list. Time zone - By default all profiles will be set to use the application's default time zone. This means that the time zone used in the application to accept/display data will be the one decided by the person who installed the system. However there are cases where you want to use a different time zone (for example, a German employee working in the German office of an American company might want to use CET instead of EST). You can change the time zone to any of the options listed in the dropdown list. LDAP DN : If LDAP is enabled at the system level, this field will be visible. It will show the current LDAP DN of any user. To force a user to use LDAP for authentication enter their valid LDAP DN. To remove LDAP from a user, blank out the LDAP DN and fill in the password field with a new password. Password : if you want to change the user's password, you can enter it in the text box. If you don't want to change the password, you can leave this blank. Security Question/Answer : if you want to change the user's challenge question/answer, enter a question that only they will know the answer to, together with the matching answer to that question. If you don't want to change the question/answer, you can leave these blank. Roles : this displays a list of the available roles in the system, with the ones that the user belongs to selected. You can change the roles by selecting them in the dropdown list. Spira Login/API Key : If you have your KronoDesk install linked up with a Spira install to keep track of development bugs and fixes, entering the user's login and API Key here will allow this user to create and view incidents related to the ticket the user is viewing. Note that these fields are only available for Internal users, and when Spira integration is enabled. Active? : Used to specify whether this user account is active or not. Approved? : Used to specify whether this user account is approved or not. Currently all users in the system are created with approved accounts. Locked Out? : Used to specify whether this user account is temporarily locked due to the user making too many incorrect login attempts. Avatar : Each user in KronoDesk can have a small graphic icon (an avatar) associated with their account. This icon will be displayed next to forum posts, ticket comments, etc. You can click on the [Browse] button to change their avatar or [Remove] to switch their user back to the default image. Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can click [Update User] to commit the changes. If there are any validation errors, they will be displayed, otherwise the system will display a confirmation box. Log In As User - This button will log you out of you own account, and log you in as the displayed user. OIf that user is currently logged into the system, they will also be logged out. This will enable you to view the system as their user account for determining any issues they may have. Create New User \u00b6 This page allows the administrator to manually create a new user. Email verification will still be needed by the end user if that setting is set. When creating the user, only basic information is set. Then, afterwards, if additional information needs to be saved (such as the user's SpiraTeam API key), it can be done after saving. Manage Organizations \u00b6 This is where you can manage the user's organizations. The system will display a list of configured organizations: By clicking on the name, you will be taken to the edit page, where you can specify data about this organization: Company Name : The name of the company. Required. Phone : Phone number. Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip/Postal Code : Mailing address. Country : The country. Required. Description : Displayed when managers/supervisors of the company edit their own profile. Internal Notes : Displayed for application administrators only. Users : List of users that are members of this organization. Users can be added by clicking the add user button ( ), and selecting the users to be added. There are three roles a user can be inside an organization: Member : These customers can see other organization tickets and view organization details and members, but can not change them. They can create new tickets. Supervisor : These customers can edit all organization tickets including changing the opener of the ticket. They can view organization details and members. Manager : These customers can do everything the Supervisor can, as well as invite new users to the organization. When users are added to an organization by the application administrator, they are automatically added as a 'Member'. When a Manager adds a user to an organization, they must know the user's email address, and the next time the user logs on they are presented with a prompt to join the organization, which they may accept or deny. User Roles \u00b6 You can create and modify user roles here. By default, the standard roles are: The following roles exist in the system and can be used when assigned permissions to users: Administrator : The most powerful role in the system, they can view, create, modify and delete all artifacts in the system (articles, tickets, forums, threads, replies) as well as access the administration section where they can change all application-wide settings. Public : All users that are viewing the site that are not logged in. Manager : This role can view, create, modify and delete all artifacts in the system (articles, tickets, forums, threads, replies). This role cannot access the Administration section Employee : This role can view everything in the non-administration section of the application. This role can view, modify and create tickets, articles, threads and replies. It cannot delete items in the system. Customer : This role can view all articles and forums, can submit new threads, reply to existing threads, can log help desk tickets and view/modify tickets that they opened only. User : This role can view all articles and forums, can submit new threads, and reply to existing threads. This role does not have any access to the help desk ticketing section of the application. When editing a role, you can give it certain permissions: The name of the role is used in the Role selection box, when editing a user. Description is just used for administration purposes, and is not displayed anywhere to end-users. Internal is a flag -- if set to true, Internal users are considered employees of the company, and have some additional permissions granted to them. If this option is set to 'No', then they are considered an External Customer (End-User). The tabs then let you specify what the role can do in each section of the application. Important Note : Roles can be stacked -- that is to say, Users can be assigned to more than one role at a time. Roles will be ANDed together. So if ANY role is marked 'Internal', then the user will be considered an employee. Likewise, if ANY role allows a user to create a ticket, then no matter what the other roles say, the user will be able to create a ticket. It is also important to note that is the section is disable entirely, setting a permission here will not have any effect. View Active Sessions \u00b6 Often an administrator of the system will want to know how many users are currently logged into the system, especially on installations licensed by concurrent-user. Clicking on the 'Active User Sessions' administration option will display a list of all the users who currently have active sessions in the system: Each user is displayed along with their user ID, whether they're connected through the application or via a third-party add-on, the date they last logged-in, and whether they are being counted as concurrent-user from a licensing perspective. With a concurrent-user license, KronoDesk allows an unlimited number of general user sessions, but only a certain number of customer service agent user sessions. The administrator is able to forcibly end a user's session using the 'End Session' link to the right of their name. Clicking this link will result in that user being logged out when they try and perform an operation in the system. Warning: You should make sure that the user is not actively using the system to prevent any unsaved data being lost . Manage Employee Groups \u00b6 Employee Groups are used to manage tickets and service level agreements (SLAs) for organizations in the system. When groups are defined, tickets can then be assigned to a group of employees, as well as individual employees (as in previous versions of the application). On the main Administration screen you can edit, delete, or create new groups. Deleting a group will remove all users from the group, and unassign all tickets (closed and open) that were assigned to that group. Creating or editing a group will give you the following page: The fields available here are: Group Name : The display name of the group. This is displayed in the Assignee field for the Ticket. Description : This is just to describe the usage of this group. Not used anywhere but in Administration. Product : Assigning a group to a specific product. For future use with SLAs. Members : The members that are a part of this group. Changes made on this page take effect immediately - after any users on the ticket pages refresh their display. LDAP Configuration \u00b6 In addition to managing users and their authentication from KronoDesk itself, the application also supports LDAP. This allows you to avoid having to store passwords in a user's KronoDesk profile. You can have both types of user exist at the same time - KronoDesk users that store their passwords inside KronoDesk, and LDAP users that use their existing LDAP passwords. To set up LDAP within KronoDesk, you must first ensure you have: a valid LDAP directory the LDAP server can communicate with the server where KronoDesk is installed On the LDAP configuration page you can edit the following properties/fields (note that the application does not perform any validation or connections checks on these fields): General Settings are all blank / unchecked by default: LDAP Enabled : Check this box to enable LDAP import or for LDAP authentication to be available. If this box is unchecked no user currently authenticated using LDAP will be able to login to the system. LDAP Host : ( must be populated to enable LDAP). This should contain the name of the LDAP server that you want SpiraPlan to connect to together with the port number if it's not the default of 389. Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) : You should select this check-box if your LDAP server requires use of the LDAPS secure protocol. Leave unchecked for unencrypted LDAP communication. Base DN : ( must be populated to import LDAP users). This should be the distinguished name of the object inside your LDAP server that contains the list of user accounts. This varies by the type of LDAP server, please consult your LDAP server documentation for more details. Bind DN : ( must be populated to import LDAP users). This should be the distinguished name of the user inside your LDAP server that will be used to authenticate against when importing users. If not provided, SpiraPlan\u00ae will try and authenticate with the LDAP server anonymously. Bind Password : ( must be populated to import LDAP users). The is the password of the user specified in the Bind DN field above. Attributes are filled out by default with the correct default values for an AD-based LDAP system: Login : When SpiraPlan\u00ae imports users from the LDAP server it needs to know the user attribute inside the LDAP server that it should use to generate the SpiraPlan\u00ae user-name. For most LDAP servers the appropriate attribute would be \"uid\". However for Windows ActiveDirectory, the attribute \"sAMAccountName\" should be used instead. First Name : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the first name field of the imported user instead of simply using the username as a placeholder. Last Name : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the last name field of the imported user instead of simply using the username as a placeholder. Middle Initial : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the middle initial field of the imported user instead of simply leaving it blank. Email Address : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the email address field of the imported user instead of simply using the username@spiratest.com as a placeholder. Sample User : You can optionally enter a sample user and password to test that the user is correctly authenticated against the server. You can update the LDAP configuration without setting this, but if you do provide a sample user/password, it will not save the configuration unless the authentication succeeds. If you choose to enter it, the user's name should be the fully-distinguished name of the user (e.g. CN=Sample User, CN=Users, OU=Headquarters, DC=MyCompany, DC=Com). Importing LDAP Users \u00b6 If LDAP is enabled and configured to allow the importing of users, click the \"Import from LDAP Server\" button on the Manage Users page to start the import process. This screen lists all the users available in the LDAP server that have not been already imported into KronoDesk (and that have a login field populated for them on the LDAP server). Users are listed with their: Common name Login First name Middle initial Last name Email address Fully distinguished LDAP name (DN). You can narrow down the list by entering partial name matches in any of the fields displayed and clicking [Filter] and/or you can sort the results by clicking on the directional arrows in the field headings. Select the checkbox of any users you want to import and click \"Import\" to complete the operation. These users can now login to KronoDesk and use their existing LDAP login and password information. Hint Only import real users who will actually be logging in. If the first name, last name, or email address are missing for a user, the system will populate these fields on import with dummy values. If the middle initial is blank for a user, no value will be entered on import.","title":"Users"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Users/#users","text":"This section contains all of the settings related to viewing and managing users in the system.

This allows you to avoid having to store passwords in a user's KronoDesk profile. You can have both types of user exist at the same time - KronoDesk users that store their passwords inside KronoDesk, and LDAP users that use their existing LDAP passwords. To set up LDAP within KronoDesk, you must first ensure you have: a valid LDAP directory the LDAP server can communicate with the server where KronoDesk is installed On the LDAP configuration page you can edit the following properties/fields (note that the application does not perform any validation or connections checks on these fields): General Settings are all blank / unchecked by default: LDAP Enabled : Check this box to enable LDAP import or for LDAP authentication to be available. If this box is unchecked no user currently authenticated using LDAP will be able to login to the system. LDAP Host : ( must be populated to enable LDAP). This should contain the name of the LDAP server that you want SpiraPlan to connect to together with the port number if it's not the default of 389. Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) : You should select this check-box if your LDAP server requires use of the LDAPS secure protocol. Leave unchecked for unencrypted LDAP communication. Base DN : ( must be populated to import LDAP users). This should be the distinguished name of the object inside your LDAP server that contains the list of user accounts. This varies by the type of LDAP server, please consult your LDAP server documentation for more details. Bind DN : ( must be populated to import LDAP users). This should be the distinguished name of the user inside your LDAP server that will be used to authenticate against when importing users. If not provided, SpiraPlan\u00ae will try and authenticate with the LDAP server anonymously. Bind Password : ( must be populated to import LDAP users). The is the password of the user specified in the Bind DN field above. Attributes are filled out by default with the correct default values for an AD-based LDAP system: Login : When SpiraPlan\u00ae imports users from the LDAP server it needs to know the user attribute inside the LDAP server that it should use to generate the SpiraPlan\u00ae user-name. For most LDAP servers the appropriate attribute would be \"uid\". However for Windows ActiveDirectory, the attribute \"sAMAccountName\" should be used instead. First Name : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the first name field of the imported user instead of simply using the username as a placeholder. Last Name : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the last name field of the imported user instead of simply using the username as a placeholder. Middle Initial : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the middle initial field of the imported user instead of simply leaving it blank. Email Address : Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the email address field of the imported user instead of simply using the username@spiratest.com as a placeholder. Sample User : You can optionally enter a sample user and password to test that the user is correctly authenticated against the server. You can update the LDAP configuration without setting this, but if you do provide a sample user/password, it will not save the configuration unless the authentication succeeds. If you choose to enter it, the user's name should be the fully-distinguished name of the user (e.g. CN=Sample User, CN=Users, OU=Headquarters, DC=MyCompany, DC=Com).","title":"LDAP Configuration"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Users/#importing-ldap-users","text":"If LDAP is enabled and configured to allow the importing of users, click the \"Import from LDAP Server\" button on the Manage Users page to start the import process.

A workflow is a predefined sequence of ticket statuses linked together by \"workflow transitions\" to enable a newly created ticket to be reviewed, prioritized, assigned, resolved and closed, as well as to handle exception cases such as the case of a duplicate or non-reproducible ticket. The initial workflow list screen when you first use the system is illustrated below: To modify the name, default status, and/or active flags, simply change the values in the appropriate text-box, radio-button or drop-down list and click the [Save] button. To add a new workflow, simply click the [Add Workflow] button and a new workflow will be created with the standard KronoDesk steps and transitions. You can have as many workflows as you like in a project, but only one can be marked as the default. Each KronoDesk product is assigned to a workflow; this allows you to have support tickets for different products follow different paths from creation to closure. However when a new product is created, it will be initially associated with the default workflow. The steps and transitions that make up the default workflow are illustrated in the diagram below: Note: You can only assign an active workflow to a KronoDesk product, and similarly you cannot make a workflow inactive that is currently linked to at least one product. This is important as all products need to be linked to an active workflow at all times. Edit Workflow Details \u00b6 Clicking on the <Steps> button of an inactive workflow brings up the following screen that lists all the workflow steps and workflow transitions that comprise the workflow: This page lists in the left-most column all the various incident statuses defined in the system. The next column lists all the possible transitions that can occur from that status . In addition, with each transition is listed the name of the resulting destination status that the transition leads to. E.g. from the assigned status, depending on your role (see later) you can move the ticket to either Open, Waiting On Customer, Waiting on Development, Duplicate and Non-Issue depending on which transition the user takes. Clicking on the name of a step or transition takes you to the appropriate details page (see below) where you can set the properties of the step or transition respectively. To delete an existing transition, simply click the <Delete> button after the transition name, and to add a new transition, click the <Add Transition> button in the Operations column. Edit Workflow Transition \u00b6 When you click on the transition name link from the previous screen, you are taken to the workflow transition details screen: The top part of the screen is the \"workflow browser\" which illustrates how the transition relates to the workflow as a whole. It displays the current transition in the middle, with the originating and destination steps listed to either side. Clicking on either ticket status name will take you to the appropriate workflow step details page. This allows you to click through the whole workflow from start to finish without having to return to the workflow details page. Each transition has a series of conditions which need to be satisfied for a user to actually execute the transition (i.e. move the ticket from the originating status to the destination status). The conditions allow you to set three types of user role: The opener of the ticket can be allowed to execute the transition when the transition occurs. For example, when a ticket is marked as Waiting on Customer, the opener should be the only one who's allowed to move it to Closed. The assignee of the ticket can be allowed to execute the transition when the transition occurs. For example, when a ticket is marked as Assigned, the assigned agent should be the only one who's allowed to move it to Waiting on Customer. A user with a specified role can be allowed to execute the transition, when the transition occurs regardless of whether they are the opener or assignee. For example a user with role \"Manager\" might want the power to close all tickets regardless of assignee status. Whether a Digital Signature is required for this transition or not. If set to Yes, then when the transition is performed, the user must re-enter their username, password, and a note (if applicable) on the transition. This signature is recorded in the History for future reporting. You can set any of these conditions by changing the drop-down list and/or check-boxes and clicking the appropriate <Save> button.

This page allows you to define the behavior of the various ticket fields (i.e. those that are a standard part of KronoDesk such as Priority) and ticket custom properties for this particular step in the workflow. You can set each of the fields/custom properties as being hidden, disabled, and/or required for each step in the workflow, and for Internal (support) users, and External (end-user) users. Note that you cannot set a field/property as being required and disabled since this would prevent a user from ever updating the ticket. For example, when a ticket is in the Open status, you might make the assignee field inactive (since the opener shouldn't need to know who will ultimately work on it), when it gets to the Assigned status, you might make the field enabled and required.

The default for unencrypted POP3 requests is 110 and the default for SSL encrypted POP3 requests is 995. Use SSL -- You should check this option if your mail server requires a secure SSL connection. Login/Password -- You should enter the login/password for the mail server that allows reading of inbound messages for the email address specified above. Remove Messages -- Checking this option will make the email integration service remove the email messages from in the Inbox of the user's email account. We recommend leaving this unchecked when first using the service. Once you are happy that the integration is correctly handling spam and not ignoring correct messages, you can check this option to prevent the email inbox getting too large.

Once you have the email integration enabled and running, any users that email in a support ticket to one of the \"watched\" email addresses will experience the following process: The customer emails support@mycompany.com with a help desk request. The contents (including attachments) of the email will be parsed by the email integration service and a new help desk ticket will be created in KronoDesk. The customer will receive an automated email from the system letting them know that the ticket was received: ------=> Please keep your reply above this line. <=- Hello Fred Bloggs The following ticket in My Company support system has been recently updated: Name: #TK438 - test 123 Priority: Status: Open Product: Product 1 Type: Assignee: Last Updated: 10/19/2012 4:29:37 PM To view the ticket, click the URL below: http://mycompany.kronodesk.net/Ticket/438.aspx If this is the first time the user has ever submitted a help desk ticket, the system will also create a new unverified user account in KronoDesk on behalf of this user. The user will then receive a separate email with information about their new account. It will provide a hyperlink that allows them to \"verify\" this new user account so that they can view/modify their help desk tickets through the website. If the user clicks on this verify link, they will be taken to KronoDesk, where they will have the option of providing a password and other security information that will allow them to access the support system through the website. If they don't verify the account, they can still respond to the ticket through email. The customer service manager(s) will assign the ticket to the appropriate customer service agent and the assigned agent will add information to the ticket either providing a possible solution to the enquiry or requesting additional information. In either case, the customer will receive an email containing the note(s) from the customer service agent. The customer can either verify their account and reply to the agent through the KronoDesk web interface, or they can simply reply to the email notifications, making sure that their comments are above the special line marked \"please reply above this line\" . Any text that is entered above this line will be added to the help desk ticket as a new note. Any attachments will be added to the existing attachments linked to the ticket This process continues until the customer's enquiry is resolved.","title":"Using the Email Integration Service with KronoDesk"},{"location":"Migration-and-Integration-Guide/Importing-from-Microsoft-Excel/","text":"Importing from Microsoft Excel \u00b6 The web-based interface of KronoDesk\u00ae is ideal for managing your company's support desk. However when first standing up the system, you may have legacy help desk tickets already in another system or in an Microsoft Office document (e.g. Excel), it is useful to be able to load in a batch of such legacy help desk tickets, rather than having to manually enter them one at a time. To simplify this task, KronoDesk\u00ae comes with a Microsoft Excel Add-In that can export help desk tickets from a populated Excel sheet into KronoDesk\u00ae. Installing the Microsoft Excel Add-In \u00b6 The first thing you need to do is to go to the KronoDesk \"Add-Ons and Downloads\" page of the Inflectra Website (it can be found in the KronoDesk section), and download the MS-Office Add-Ins installation package: MS-Office 2010 Add-Ins -- these are compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 and 2013. They can connect to KronoDesk v1.1 or later. They also require Microsoft .NET 4.0. This installation package will install the add-ins for Microsoft Excel onto your local PC You can connect to either a cloud-hosted or on-premise version of KronoDesk. If you don't have the correct version of Microsoft .NET installed or some of the necessary prerequisites, you will be given the opportunity to install them when you first run the installation package. Once you have the Excel Add-In installed, the second thing you'll need to download is the KronoDeskImportTemplate Excel Sheet. This spreadsheet contains the necessary pre-formatted columns that are needed for the Add-In to easily recognize the data and know how to handle it. Once you have downloaded the template, please double-click on it to open it up in MS-Excel. You will notice that there is an additional ribbon entry under the \"Add-Ins\" tab in Excel which is used for importing/exporting data to/from KronoDesk: This ribbon allow you to connect to KronoDesk, and perform the import/export. The process for using this toolbar is described below: Connecting to KronoDesk\u00ae \u00b6 The first thing you need to do is to click on the [Connect] button to specify the information used to connect to your instance of KronoDesk: Please enter the following information into the dialog box: KronoDesk URL: Please enter the web address that you use to access KronoDesk\u00ae in your browser. This is usually of the form http://hostname/KronoDesk or https://mycompany.kronodesk.net . Make sure that you remove any suffixes from the address (e.g. Default.aspx). User Name: Please enter the username that you use for logging in to KronoDesk Password: Please enter the password that you use for logging in to KronoDesk Remember Password: If you are using this Add-In on a private computer, you can check this option to have the system remember your credentials locally. Please do not use this option on a public computer and it will compromise the security of your KronoDesk installation. Once you have entered the necessary information, please click [Connect] to authenticate with the server. If the login information is invalid, you will see an error message appear, otherwise you will be connected and the list of projects and artifacts will be populated. If you want to end your session, you should just click the [Disconnect] button and the Add-In will close your connection. Choosing the Artifact Type \u00b6 Once you have successfully connected to KronoDesk, you should now choose the appropriate Artifact in the system that you will be importing / exporting ( currently only Tickets are supported ): The artifact choice will match the name of the Excel sheet in the template, so if you are going to be exporting Tickets, you should choose \"Tickets\" from the dropdown list and then click on the \"Tickets\" tab inside the Excel import template. Once you have selected the artifact, there are three buttons that you can now use: Export: Clicking this button will take the data in the spreadsheet and use it to add/update items in KronoDesk. Import: Clicking this button will retrieve the data from the KronoDesk server and use that to populate the spreadsheet. [This is currently not available in the Add-In] Clear: This button allows you to quickly clear the data in the import template while leaving all the necessary headings and other information that the Add-In needs to be able to import/export data. Options: This button allows you to change some of the import/export options. Exporting Data \u00b6 The Excel Add-In is capable of exporting help desk ticket data from the Excel template to KronoDesk. Configuring the Lookups \u00b6 The Excel template contains a special 'Lookups' sheet in the Excel workbook. Before actually performing the export, you should review this sheet to make sure the list of products, statuses, priorities and resolutions match your instance of KronoDesk: Normally you would need to change at least the list of Products (since it will have the three sample products by default) and depending on how you have customized your instance, you will also need to adjust the statuses, priorities and resolutions (currently Type is not used and can be ignored). To get the appropriate list of products, statuses, priorities and resolutions, go to the Administration section of KronoDesk and display the appropriate screens. For example, for products: Make sure that the products, statuses, priorities and resolutions in the Excel workbook match the ID and the value displayed in KronoDesk. Once that has been done, you are now ready to export your data. Exporting Tickets \u00b6 To export tickets, first you need to click on the \"Tickets\" sheet in the Excel workbook: Next you should click on the [Clear] icon to first remove the sample information from the spreadsheet. Once you have the sheet ready for export, you need to either enter the tickets into this specially formatted spreadsheet or cut and paste them in from another existing Excel sheet that you've been using to manage tickets previously (or from the output of another tool). Then click [Export] and the new items will be added to your instance of KronoDesk. The various columns that can be imported/exported, and the rules for entering data are listed below: Tkt # Stores the ID of the ticket. Should be left blank for new items being added to KronoDesk Ticket Subject The subject / name of the help desk ticket. Ticket Description The long description of the ticket. If you want it formatted, you need to add HTML tags such as <b> for bold Product The name of the KronoDesk product that you want to associate the ticket with. It needs to be one of the values from the dropdown list. Status The status of the ticket. It needs to be one of the values from the dropdown list. Priority The priority of the ticket. It needs to be one of the values from the dropdown list. Resolution The resolution of the ticket. It needs to be one of the values from the dropdown list. Opener The user that opened the ticket. Needs to be the ID of the user (e.g. user US00005 would be entered as just 5). If left blank, it will default to the user logged in through the Add-In. Assignee The internal user that the ticket should be assigned to Needs to be the ID of the user (e.g. user US00005 would be entered as just 5) Creation Date The date that the ticket was logged. If this field is not populated, the current date is used instead Closed Date The date that the ticket was closed. Do not enter a value in this field if the ticket is not in a closed status. Comment The description of a comment/note that should be appended to the ticket. If you want it formatted, you need to add HTML tags such as <b> for bold. Note that this field always appends, so if you want to add two comments, just enter the first value and click [Export], then replace it with the second value and click [Export] Note: the columns that are required are listed in bold type. Changing the Import/Export Options \u00b6 You can change how the import/export works by clicking on the Options icon. This brings up the Options dialog box: When you import artifacts from KronoDesk into MS-Excel, if they have a formatted description, by default all the HTML tags that are used to describe the formatting will be loaded into the Excel cell. This is useful if you plan on making changes and then updating KronoDesk (since it will preserve the formatting). However if you want to be able to more easily read the descriptions in Excel and do not plan on updating KronoDesk, you can select the option to Remove the Formatting, which will convert the descriptions to plain-text before loading them into Excel.","title":"Importing from Excel"},{"location":"Migration-and-Integration-Guide/Importing-from-Microsoft-Excel/#importing-from-microsoft-excel","text":"The web-based interface of KronoDesk\u00ae is ideal for managing your company's support desk.

The home page shows: general help information (which can be fully customized based on your needs) company updates (via an RSS feed you can specify) lists of popular and new articles (from the knowledge base) a list of recent forums posts Before logging in as an administrator and showing you how to add new articles, forum posts and help desk tickets, let's start by seeing what information a guest user can see. Viewing Knowledge Base Articles \u00b6 When a user has a problem and needs help, their first level of support should be to look for a pre-written Knowledge Base (KB) article that has been written by a support agent. Users can find articles either by searching or by browsing the available topics. To search, enter a search term (for example, \"error message\") in the KB search box on the home page: This will automatically display a drop-down list of matching articles and can click on an article to view it: To browse the knowledge base, instead of searching, click the 'browse the knowledge base' link below the search box to view articles organized by category: Users can navigate to the category they are interested in, view articles for that category, or drill down into sub-categories. They can also click one of the top tags used in the articles, to view all related articles: Another way to search the knowledge base is to enter your search into the global search box at the top of the screen and click the search button to the right. KronoDesk will display a list of articles (and other matching items) in the results window: Clicking on one of the articles in the search results will bring up the full text of the article. Browsing the Support Forums \u00b6 If you were unable to solve your problem by finding a matching article, your next option is to look into the forums to see if another user has experienced the same problem. Click on a specific forum (e.g. Library Catalog Issues & Questions): KronoDesk will display the list of threads in the forum you selected. The list is sorted with the most recent threads at the top. Click on one of the threads (for example \"How do I install the library catalog system onto my computer?\") to display the full conversation: KronoDesk displays the original message together with replies by different users. If a user wants to reply to the thread they will be prompted to login first (if they are not already logged in). If you are interested in this topic, you can click on the breadcrumb links at the top of the page to find other threads in the same forum or category. In addition, you can click on one of the meta tags to display a list of other related threads (that may be in a different forum or category altogether): Using the Help Desk Ticketing System \u00b6 Once a user has looked at the public information, if they still cannot find an answer to their problem they typically submit a help desk ticket to the support team. This section shows you how to use the help desk in KronoDesk. Submitting a New Ticket \u00b6 First, login as a customer using the following credentials: Login: carlacustomer Password: PleaseChange By default, her account role allows her to open support tickets, so you should now see the 'Help Desk' menu item in the top navigation bar. Clicking on it will reveal Carla's open tickets: To submit a new help desk ticket, click on the 'Open Ticket' link in the left-hand sidebar. This will bring up the page where basic information can be added to a new ticket: First, select the Product 'Library Catalog System' and, now when you enter the title for the ticket, a list of potentially helpful KB articles will be displayed: If you see an article that may help you, you can click on it to open the article in a new tab or window to review. If none of the KB articles help, you can continue filling out the fields to submit a new support ticket. Make sure you fill in all the required fields (the name and description as well as those marked with an asterisk and shown in bold). You can upload files and select the Type here as well. Go ahead and complete the support ticket and click \"Submit\". The system will let you know that the ticket was submitted successfully. Once the ticket is submitted, switch roles so you can simulate being the customer service agent, responding to the ticket. Responding to a Ticket \u00b6 Click the 'Sign Out' link and login as an employee using the following credentials: Login: ericemployee Password: PleaseChange Once you have logged in you will see the employee dashboard. If you don't see it right away, click on the 'Home Page' link. This view lets you see all of the help desk tickets assigned to you, as well as any tickets that are not currently assigned to any support agent, as well as other items you may have subscribed to or written. Click on the main 'Help Desk' link and KronoDesk will provide you with a filterable, sortable list of help desk tickets: Make sure you have the list set to the 'Unassigned Tickets' view and then select the new help desk ticket that you just submitted by clicking the appropriate row. Now choose the option from the left sidebar menu 'Assign Ticket to Me'. Alternatively, you can right-click on the ticket (long press on mobile devices) and select 'Assign Ticket to Me'.) Once you have done that, switch the view to 'Assigned Tickets' and verify that the new ticket has been assigned: Now click on the hyperlink for the new ticket and you will see the ticket details page: This page lets you see all the details of the submitted ticket, including custom fields (shown in the sidebar on the left). KronoDesk is customizable to require different fields for each product and each stage the ticket goes through. Click on the status dropdown highlighted at the top where it is says \"Assigned\". Assigned is the current status. Change the status to 'Waiting on Customer'. The options will vary depending on the current status of the ticket, as defined in the application's Workflow. Add comment that describes your proposed solution by clicking on any of the reply buttons: Once you are finished updating the ticket, click \"Submit\" and the ticket will be returned to the customer (the status changes to 'Waiting on Customer') and an email will be sent, notifying them of the change and proposed solution. Now that you have responded to the customer, you can log back in as a customer to see how the response would be received. View Response as Customer \u00b6 You need to click the 'Sign Out' link and login as the customer using the original credentials: Login: carlacustomer Password: PleaseChange This will then return you to the customer Home Page and scroll to the section that displays a list of your open help desk tickets: You will see the ticket you had submitted is now 'Waiting on Customer'. That means it is has either a clarifying question or a potential solution from the support agent. Click on the ticket title to display the response from the agent: You can see on this page the original question / problem and the most recent response, together with the complete contact history from the customer and all the support personnel who have worked on this ticket. Let's pretend that the solution worked and we want to close the ticket. Click on the 'Change Status' dropdown, and select 'Close Ticket'. Enter a note back to the agent, and then click 'Submit'. The ticket will now be closed. Congratulations! You have submitted a help desk ticket, responded to it as a support agent and then closed the ticket. The last thing to demonstrate, is to see how a manager would log-in and view/triage all the open help desk tickets. Searching for Tickets \u00b6 You need to click the 'Sign Out' link and login as a manager using the following credentials: Login: marthamanager Password: PleaseChange Once you have correctly logged in you will see the employee dashboard. Click on the main 'Help Desk' menu entry to display the manager-view. As a manager-level user, you can view: All the open tickets All of the closed tickets All tickets (open and closed) In any of these three views you can sort and filter the list of tickets by any of the columns displayed in the ticket list: You can use the operations in the sidebar to bulk assign help desk tickets to specific users, delete bad or duplicate tickets or merge tickets together. Tickets can be selected by clicking on the row. To select a range of tickets, click on the first ticket, then shift-click on the last ticket. Control-Click to add or remove a ticket from the selection. Configuring and Customizing \u00b6 You have now tried out KronoDesk both as a user viewing the knowledge base and forums, as a customer submitting a help desk ticket, and as a manager. This section describes the steps needed to configure the system for real use by your organization. To perform the configuration, you will need to login as the Administration using these credentials: Login: administrator Password: PleaseChange Once you have successfully logged-in, click on the Administration menu item to bring up the Administration home page: There are many different areas you can configure in the Administration section. For example, you can customize the different ticket types, statuses, and priorities, you can enter the various products, forums and article categories you will need. You can also disable sections of KronoDesk that you won't be using (for example, some of our customers don't need a public forum). These are all described in more detail in the KronoDesk Administration Guide . The next sections will illustrate a couple of important setup steps that you will need to perform before you start using KronoDesk for real. Configure Branding \u00b6 Under System Settings > Appearance, you will have two tabs. The first tab, 'Appearance', will let you select one of the pre-installed themes, or edit a theme to customize the applications appearance to match your company color scheme. The edit theme page will let you set various colors for different parts of the application: The second tab, 'Branding', will let you set certain text and page names. In this section you should change the name of the site from 'KronoDesk' to your company name, enter in the email address, phone number and other information that you'd like to describe your support site. This page lets you change the color scheme of KronoDesk, upload your company logo (full size image for desktop devices and a smaller icon for use on the mobile version) and generally change how it will look. For example, we use KronoDesk ourselves and we have rebranded it as follows: Remove Sample Data & Start Using \u00b6 Finally, once you are ready to start using KronoDesk, you will want to delete all of the sample categories, products, forums, threads, articles, help desk tickets and users, and then create your own categories and settings. To do that, go to 'System Settings > Remove Sample Data'. Click on the 'Remove Sample Data' button to confirm your decision: Congratulations, you are now ready to use KronoDesk. You can now add users, products and forums. For more information about any of the features, please refer to the: KronoDesk User Manual KronoDesk Administration & Install Guide .

Dashboards \u00b6 When a customer first accesses KronoDesk, they are taken to the KronoDesk Customer Homepage. This page is designed to provide them with an easy to use starting point for resolving their support issue. They are provided with tools for searching the online knowledge base, asking questions in the support forums and a link to create a help desk ticket. The dashboard also includes recent knowledge base articles, news updates, and recent forum posts so that they can keep on top of recent development and contribute back into the support community. For customer service agents, the Employee Homepage provides them with a consolidated view of their assigned tickets, any tickets not current assigned, recent forum posts, and current news updates so they can see all inbound requests from customers in one single place, ensuring that they are able to monitor the support forums and help desk from a single screen. Knowledge Base \u00b6 The KronoDesk\u00ae online knowledge base provides the first level of support to customers. Instead of having to constantly respond to the same routine enquiries and support requests, customer support agents can use the built-in knowledge base to create articles related to different topics, categories and products. Knowledge base articles can be linked to multiple categories and also tagged with meta-tags to make searching easier by customers. The system includes full rich-text editor so that articles can be formatted with lists, tables, different text styles and embedded hyperlinks. Support Forums \u00b6 The KronoDesk\u00ae support forums provide the next level of support to customers. Where a fully codified knowledge base article has not yet been synthesized and created by the support agents, the support forums provide a place where users can search for existing messages concerning the same problem. The support forums thereby provide a community where customers and support agents can post replies to common questions visible to the entire community. This provides a faster turnaround for customers who can find immediate solutions to their issues and enables the support agents to focus their time on dealing customer issues that have not been previously encountered or customers issues that particularly complex or environment-specific. Help Desk Ticketing \u00b6 The KronoDesk\u00ae help desk ticket management system provides the final level of customer support. When a customer cannot readily find the solution through either the knowledge base or support forums, they can submit a help desk ticket through KronoDesk's help desk submission system. The system allows them to quickly and easily enter the description of the problem, attach any relevant documents or screenshots, categorize the issue and then submit it for resolution by the support agents. The customer support agents can use the help desk system to review incoming tickets, assign them to themselves or other support agents as needed, provide suggestions to the customer, or escalate to the next level of support. They can use the system to add notes to the ticket, change the fields, or ask for more information. Any changes made to the ticket will be notified to the customer so that they're kept abreast of changes to their ticket. In addition, the customer can use their customer homepage to see a list of their open tickets together to see at a glance what action has been taken and what recommendations have been made. User Account Management \u00b6 KronoDesk\u00ae supports the management of an unlimited number of users, which can be administered through the same web interface as the rest of the application, and each user of the system can be given a specific role in the system. In addition, each user has a secure Account management section of the application where they can update their personal information, manage their subscriptions and change their password information. In addition to these administration functions, each user has their own personalized dashboard view of all the pertinent and relevant information. This feature reduces the information overload associated with managing such a rich source of information, and allows a single customer and employee snapshot to be viewable at all times for rapid decision-making. Miscellaneous \u00b6 Artifact Relationships \u00b6 The sections above have outlined the different features and functions available in the system, and have described the various artifacts managed in the system (e.g. tickets, articles, forums, threads, etc.). To aid in understanding how the information is related, the following diagrams illustrates the relationships between the different artifacts and entities: Figure 1: The relationships between the various KronoDesk entities With these overall concepts in mind, the rest of this help manual will outline the functionality in each of the KronoDesk\u00ae screens, and provide specific information on how to manage each of the artifacts illustrated above.

Artifact Naming Conventions \u00b6 On various screens in the system, you will see lists of artifacts (tickets, articles, etc.) together with a unique identification number. In order to make it easier to recognize at a glance which type of artifact the identification number refers to, KronoDesk uses a system of two-letter prefixes which help identify the type of artifact being displayed. The current prefixes used by the system are: Artifact Prefix Artifact Prefix Ticket TK Knowledge Base Article KB Ticket Status TS User US Ticket Type TT Forum FR Ticket Priority TP Thread TH Ticket Resolution TR Message MG Product PR In addition, certain artifacts in the system are displayed with an icon that helps distinguish them from each other, and provides additional context on the state of the artifact: Icon Artifact Description Knowledge Base Article Forum Category Forum Thread Help Desk Ticket SpiraTeam\u00ae Incident Artifact has an Attachment","title":"Functionality Overview"},{"location":"User-Manual/Functionality-Overview/#functionality-overview","text":"This section outlines the functionality provided by KronoDesk\u00ae in the areas of help desk ticketing, customer support forums, online knowledge base and user account management.","title":"Functionality Overview"},{"location":"User-Manual/Functionality-Overview/#dashboards","text":"When a customer first accesses KronoDesk, they are taken to the KronoDesk Customer Homepage.

In order to make it easier to recognize at a glance which type of artifact the identification number refers to, KronoDesk uses a system of two-letter prefixes which help identify the type of artifact being displayed. The current prefixes used by the system are: Artifact Prefix Artifact Prefix Ticket TK Knowledge Base Article KB Ticket Status TS User US Ticket Type TT Forum FR Ticket Priority TP Thread TH Ticket Resolution TR Message MG Product PR In addition, certain artifacts in the system are displayed with an icon that helps distinguish them from each other, and provides additional context on the state of the artifact: Icon Artifact Description Knowledge Base Article Forum Category Forum Thread Help Desk Ticket SpiraTeam\u00ae Incident Artifact has an Attachment","title":"Artifact Naming Conventions"},{"location":"User-Manual/Help-Desk/","text":"Help Desk \u00b6 The KronoDesk\u00ae help desk ticket management system provides the final level of customer support. When a customer cannot readily find the solution through either the knowledge base or support forums, they can submit a help desk ticket through KronoDesk's help desk submission system. The system allows them to quickly and easily enter the description of the problem, attach any relevant documents or screenshots, categorize the issue and then submit it for resolution by the support agents. Ticket List \u00b6 When you click on the Help Desk option in the global navigation, you will be taken to the main help desk page: This page displays on the left-hand side a list of display options for viewing the help desk. The available options will depend on your role in the system. In general customers can only see their submitted tickets whereas customer support agents can see all the tickets in the system. The following display options are available to external users: My Opened Tickets - This displays a list of all the open tickets that were opened by the current user. My Closed Tickets - This displays a list of all the closed tickets that were opened by the current user. Organization Tickets - This displays a list of all the open tickets that were opened by anyone in your organization (only displays for users who are a member of an organization). The following display options are available to support agents: My Assigned Tickets -- This displays a list of all the open tickets assigned to the current user. Unassigned Tickets - This displays a list of all the open tickets that are not assigned to any support agents. All Open Tickets -- This displays a list of all the open tickets regardless of who opened them or who they are assigned to. All Closed Tickets - This displays a list of all the closed tickets regardless of who opened them or who they are assigned to. All Tickets - This displays a list of all the tickets regardless of their status, who opened them or who they are assigned to. In addition, there is an Operations pane that is displayed for support agents and lets you perform the following tasks: Assign Tickets to Me -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and then click this option, it will assign the selected tickets to your user. Assign Tickets to User -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and then click this option, it will allow you to assign the selected tickets to a specific customer agent. Unassign Tickets -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and then click this option, it will return the ticket to the unassigned list. Merge Tickets -- If you select two or more tickets in the grid (using SHIFT+click or CTRL+click) then click merge, the system will prompt you to select a primary ticket that the others will be merged into. It then combines the selected into that primary ticket, with each message added as a separate note. Delete Tickets -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid, then click this option, it will permanently delete the selected tickets. Typically this is only used for tickets generated from spam emails. Filtering and Sorting \u00b6 The main ticket grid allows you to filter and sort the ticket list. You sort a column by simply clicking on the arrow in the header row. To filter the ticket list, simply enter the text into the search box and the ticket list will be automatically filtered: If you want to undo the filter, simply clear the filter and the full ticket list will be displayed. Changing Columns \u00b6 To show and hide different columns in the ticket grid, click on the columns icon above the grid and the column selector will be displayed: Once you have chosen the columns to display or hide simply click away from the dialog and the column selector will close and the grid will be reloaded with the new columns. Auto-Refreshing \u00b6 Sometimes as a support agent it is useful to have the ticket list auto-refresh every couple of seconds to ensure that you are seeing the most up-to-date information. Clicking on the \"Auto Refresh\" icon will enable this feature. Export to Excel \u00b6 To export the current list of tickets to an Excel Comma Separated Values (CSV) file, simply click on the 'Excel' icon and the current ticket list will be exported into an MS-Excel compatible CSV file: Context Menu \u00b6 KronoDesk\u00ae provides a handy shortcut for performing frequent operations on the ticket list. Simply hover the mouse over the ticket grid and click the right mouse button. This brings up the context menu: You can use this to perform the following operations: Assign Tickets to Me -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and then click this option, it will assign the selected tickets to your user. Assign Tickets to User -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and then click this option, it will allow you to assign the selected tickets to a specific customer agent. Unassign Tickets -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and then click this option, it will return the ticket to the unassigned list. Merge Tickets -- If you select two or more tickets in the grid (using SHIFT+click or CTRL+click) then click merge, the system will combine them into a single ticket for you. Delete Tickets -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid, then click this option, it will permanently delete the selected tickets. Typically this is only used for tickets generated from spam emails. Create New Ticket \u00b6 If you click on the hyperlink to \"Open Ticket\", the system will display the new help desk ticket entry page: This page displays the following information: Opener -- When a customer support agent opens a ticket, they are opening it on behalf of a customer (for instance during a phone call). You can type a name, email address, or organization name into this field to get a list of possible matches. When a customer opens a ticket they do not see this field. Product -- Each ticket has to be assigned to a specific product, which can be selected from the dropdown list Subject/Description -- This section of the page allows you to enter the subject and long description of the customer's support issue. The long description allows formatted text and can include lists, tables and hyperlinks. Ticket Fields -- This section displays all the fields that need to be filled out when submitting the ticket. The fields that are required are displayed in bold type with an asterisk(*) next to the field name. When you change the product name field that may change the workflow associated with the ticket. If that happens, you will see some of the fields change. This is normal and allows the administrator to tailor the fields required to the type of product (e.g. a web application may need you to enter the browser type, whereas a mobile application would need to know the cellphone network) Attachments -- This section is described in more detail below in Adding a Document Attachment Please note that when a customer is creating a ticket, KronoDesk will dynamically search the knowledge base to see if there are any articles that could answer their question, based on what they enter as the ticket's subject: Adding a Document Attachment \u00b6 You can drag and drop files onto the attachment area: As you add documents, they will appear in this control. To add a new attachment to the ticket, either drag and drop the files onto this control or click on the arrow to browse your local file system. Once the documents are attached they will be listed below the attachment area: You can remove any items by selecting the item and clicking the \"Delete Selected\" x. Note: The system uses file extensions to identity the type of file, so if your local operating system doesn't use file extensions, you may want to rename the file before uploading (e.g. changing MyDocument to MyDocument.pdf to identity it as an Acrobat document). Adding a Screenshot \u00b6 To include a screenshot in your ticket, first copy the image to your computer's clipboard (e.g. on Windows computers, the PRINT SCREEN button captures the current page and adds to the clipboard). Once the image is in the clipboard, position the cursor in the ticket Description text box where you want it to appear and then click CTRL+V to paste the image. The image will then be attached to the ticket and embedded in the rich text box. Ticket Details \u00b6 If you click on the hyperlink for a specific ticket in either the main ticket list page, one of the user dashboards, or the navigation sidebar, you will be taken to the details page for the specific ticket: This page is made up of three areas; the sidebar (left), the header (top right), and the journal (bottom right). The sidebar has two views. In both views there is a submit button at top. By default the sidebar shows: information about the opener of the ticket an uploader area a list of custom fields The alternate view of the sidebar is to show lists of relevant tickets to the user and can be used to quickly jump to other tickets. You can switch between these two views at any time by clicking the button in the top left (just to the left of the submit button). The header contains the ticket name and other important meta-data. The journal contains information associated with the activity taken over the course of the ticket. There are up to four types of data that the journal shows. Each user can show or hide the information based on their needs, by clicking the filter buttons, or change the sort order to be by date ascending or descending. The four types of information shown in the journal: Notes -- the description of the original ticket plus a list of all the notes added by support personnel and the original submitter. Attachments -- any file added to the ticket Incidents -- If you have the integration with SpiraPlan\u00ae enabled, you will see any incidents (defects, bugs, change requests, etc.) related to the current ticket. History --shows you the change history for the ticket. Changing Fields and Statuses \u00b6 When editing an existing ticket, the fields that are available and the fields that are required will depend on your stage in the ticket workflow. For example, an open ticket might not require an \"Assignee\" whereas an assigned ticket typically would not. The types of change allowed and the email notifications that are sent will depend on how the system administrator has configured the workflow. Administrators should refer to the KronoDesk Administration Guide for details on configuring the ticket workflows to meet their needs. The workflow controls both the meta-data fields shown in the header, as well as any custom fields shown in the sidebar. Depending on the user's role and whether they are listed as the opener or assignee of the ticket, displayed in the top-left of the header, is a dropdown list with the allowed workflow operations: These workflow transitions allow the user to move the ticket from one status to another. For example in the default workflow, when the ticket is in the Assigned status, you will be given the options to change the status to one of: \"Open\" \"Waiting on Customer\" \"Waiting on Development\" \"Duplicate\" \"Non-Issue\" After changing the status of the ticket by clicking on the workflow link, you can then fill in the additional fields that are now enabled and/or required. Once you've made the changes to the appropriate ticket fields, click on the \"Submit\" button in the sidebar (at the top left of the screen). Some transitions may require a digital signature. In the workflow dropdown, those transitions will be marked with a lock symbol. Upon saving, you will be given a prompt: You must re-enter in your password, and an additional reason/meaning for the transition before the application will allow you to save your changed. Using the Journal to view comments \u00b6 The journal displays the entire history of a ticket, and most importantly all communication between agents and the customer. All messages from customers are shown in one color background (pale yellow in the default application theme). All messages to customers from agents are in a different color (light gray in the default application theme). Clicking at the top of each message / note will expand or collapse that note, to help scrolling through long tickets, or reviewing new information. Using the button at the top of the journal, you can also expand or collapse all comments at once. Here all comments are expanded: And here they are all collapsed: Any notes that are 'internal only' and therefore only visible to customer support agents, are displayed with a red background (in the default application theme) with a mute icon at the top left: Adding Notes \u00b6 You can reply to a ticket at any time by clicking the reply button in the journal toolbar (the rightmost button): You can also reply using any reply button on any expanded ticket note. This will show the reply window directly underneath that note. You can even start replying to one note and then click on another note to move the reply window to that second note. The new note / reply will always get added to the ticket in the same way, but it can be helpful to 'attach' the reply window to a specific note you need to refer to in a reply. You need to enter the note text in the rich-text box. As soon as you do you will see the button to the bottom left of the reply window become active and say \"Submit\". Click this will save all changes to the ticket and add the note to the ticket at the same time. If you would like to insert a Knowledge Base (KB) article into your reply to the user, you can click on the link \"Add KB to Note\" (this is only visible to agents): You then select the KB article from the available list, choose the type of link to insert (name and link only, full article text, etc.). Then click the 'Insert Template' to populate the note with the KB article link/text. There are a number of templates you can use. These are all configurable by the application administrator. To include a screenshot in your note, first copy the image to your computer's clipboard (e.g. on Windows computers, the PRINT SCREEN button captures the current page and adds to the clipboard). Once the image is in the clipboard, position the cursor in the Note text box where you want it to appear and then click CTRL+V to paste the image. The image will then be attached to the ticket and embedded in the note text. CC's to a Ticket \u00b6 With KronoDesk's cc functionality, a user can make sure other interested parties are copied in to all email notifications about a ticket. If a user creates a ticket via email and adds cc's to that email, they will automatically be added as a cc to the ticket. You can tell that a ticket has cc's on them by looking at the ticket header -- there is a cc badge to the left of the ticket name: To view and edit the cc's on the ticket (any valid email address can be used), click on downward facing arrow on the right hand side of the ticket header (the \"more actions\" button). Attachments \u00b6 The attachments pane of the sidebar gives a drag and drop area for adding files to a ticket. Files added in the current editing session (before clicking \"Submit\") are shown below the attachment pane. Older files are shown in the journal. The documents can be in any format, though KronoDesk\u00ae will only display the icon for certain known types: The attachment list includes the filename/URL that was originally uploaded together with the file-size (in KB), name of the person who attached it and the date uploaded. To actually view the document, simply click on the filename hyperlink and a new web browser window will open. Depending on the type of file, this window will either display the document / web-page or prompt you for a place to save it on your local computer. To remove an existing attachment from a ticket, simply select the item and click the [Delete] button. To attach a new document to the ticket, you simply drag them onto the attachment upload control or click on the upload button and then browse to find the file on your local filesystem. Note: The system uses file extensions to identity the type of file, so if your local operating system doesn't use file extensions, you may want to rename the file before uploading (e.g. changing MyDocument to MyDocument.pdf to identity it as an Acrobat document). Incidents \u00b6 SpiraPlan\u00ae incidents linked to the current help desk ticket are shown in the journal (as long as the current user has permission to view them). To check or change your connection to Spira click on the \"user profile\" link and enter your SpiraPlan username and RSS Token into your KronoDesk user profile. This is described in more detail in Edit Profile . Once your KronoDesk user is linked to a corresponding SpiraPlan user, you will see a list of SpiraPlan incidents that were generated from the current ticket in the journal, organized with other journal items based on the date the incident was created: Each incident is displayed with its: incident ID name status owner last update date. Hovering over the incident name will give a tooltip of the incident description. Clicking on the incident name/hyperlink will open the incident in SpiraPlan in a new window. This allows support agents to view the status of the incidents use it to determine when the ticket can be resolved because the underlying product issue has been resolved. To log a new incident in SpiraPlan based on the current help desk ticket, click on downward facing arrow on the right hand side of the ticket header (the \"more actions\" button). To \"Add New Incident\" make sure a SpiraPlan project is selected from the dropdown list (if the name of the product for the ticket matches the name of any SpiraPlan project, that project will be automatically selected for you): This dialog lets you add a new incident to the linked instance of SpiraPlan. The system will prepopulate the description of the incident with the ticket description. You can edit this text or clear it completely and enter in custom content. You then need to enter an incident name, and choose values for other fields based on what fields are required (this is set inside SpiraPlan on a project by project basis). Once you are satisfied, click \"Add\" to add the incident to SpiraPlan. Once the incident has been added, it will appear in the KronoDesk journal. Note: You need to make sure that the SpiraPlan user that you have associated with your KronoDesk profile has permissions to create new incidents in that project in SpiraPlan. History \u00b6 The journal displays the list of changes that have been performed on the help desk ticket artifact since its creation. An example ticket change history is shown below: The change history displays the date that each change was made, together with the fields that were changed, the old and new values and the person who made the change. This allows a complete audit trail to be maintained of all changes in the system. Navigating tickets using the sidebar \u00b6 When viewing the sidebar as a list of tickets, you will see links to take you back to the ticket list and to create a new ticket. There will also be a list of peer tickets to the one selected. This latter list is useful as a navigation shortcut; you can quickly view the peer tickets by clicking on the navigation links without having to first return to the ticket list page. The navigation list can be switched between four different modes: The list of tickets matching the current filter The list of all tickets, irrespective of the current filter The list of tickets assigned to the current user The list of tickets opened by the current user Working More Efficiently Using Keyboard Shortcuts \u00b6 Press the question mark symbol on your keyboard to bring up a list of available keyboard shortcuts. These should allow you to operate the entire ticket details page without requiring a mouse and can greatly speed up your workflow as you reply to, and manage your tickets.","title":"Help Desk"},{"location":"User-Manual/Help-Desk/#help-desk","text":"The KronoDesk\u00ae help desk ticket management system provides the final level of customer support.

Clicking on the \"Display Data Grid\" link will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the Download Data as CSV link will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats). Ticket Open Count \u00b6 The open ticket count chart displays the net number of open tickets in the system over a particular date-range categorized by ticket priority, either for all ticket types and/or products or for a specific ticket type and/or product: In this version of the report, the y-axis represents the number of tickets, and the x-axis represents a specific week in the time-span. The exact count of each bar in the stacked histogram can be viewed by positioning the mouse pointer over the bar, and a \"tooltip\" will pop-up listing the actual data value. You can also filter the type of ticket being reported, the product the ticket was reported against, as well as change the date interval. If you choose a smaller date-range, the x-axis will switch from weekly to daily and if you choose a larger date-range, the x-axis will switch to monthly. Clicking on the \"Display Data Grid\" link will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the Download Data as CSV link will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats). Ticket Aging \u00b6 The ticket aging chart displays the number of days tickets have been left open in the system. The chart is organized as a stacked histogram, with the count of tickets on the y-axis and different age intervals on the x-axis. Each bar-chart color represents a different ticket priority, giving an IT service manager a snapshot view of the age of open tickets by priority. This report can be filtered by the type of ticket and/or product, so for example you can see the aging of just support tickets, or just tickets for a specific product. Clicking on the \"Display Data Grid\" link will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the Download Data as CSV link will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats). Ticket Turnaround Time \u00b6 The incident turnaround time chart displays the number of days incidents have taken to be closed (from the time they were first raised) in the system. The chart is organized as a stacked histogram, with the count of incidents on the y-axis and different turnaround time intervals on the x-axis. Each bar-chart color represents a different incident priority, giving a project manager a snapshot view of the turnaround time of project incidents by priority. This report can be filtered by the type of ticket and the product, so for example you can see the turnaround time of just infrastructure tickets, or just tickets for a specific product. Clicking on the \"Display Data Grid\" link will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the Download Data as CSV link will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats). Ticket Custom Graphs \u00b6 The ticket custom graph widget shows how many tickets are currently in the system. The number of tickets is displayed according to the criteria that you specify. You can specify the type of data displayed along the x-axis, and the ticket information that is used to group the data. When you first open the graph you will be asked to pick the field that you would like to display on the x-axis and the field that you would like to group the data by. Once you have chosen the appropriate fields the graph will be displayed: In the illustration above, the x-axis represents the ticket status, and the individual bars are grouped by the priority of the ticket. Each data-value can be viewed by positioning the mouse pointer over the bar, and a \"tooltip\" will pop-up listing the actual data value. Clicking on the \"Display Data Grid\" link will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the Download Data as CSV link will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats). Reports \u00b6 Kronodesk has nine different reports covering the help desk, knowledge base, organizations, and users. Each report can be exported in a number of different formats, including PDF, Word, and Excel. Each report can also be filtered by a number of different fields and sorted by a particular field as well. These features make it easy to quickly generate a report to explore a subset of all the data in the system. For example, you can create a report showing all tickets in the last six months for one product that have been resolved. Below is a report configuration page to illustrate the exporting, filtering, and sorting options available. Here we are looking at the Ticket Details report. To create the report, configure the options as required, then click \"Create Report\". The report will then be dynamically created live. To view the report follow the onscreen instructions.
