However a good first place to look for the cause is inside the Windows Event Viewer, which stores all errors raised in the system.</p> <p>To open the Event Viewer, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Event Viewer. This will open up the event viewer:</p> <p></p> <p>Click on the Application and System folders in turn and look for errors raised by \"MSSQLSERVER\", \"KronoDesk\", \"DCOM\", \"ASPNET\" or \"IIS\". Click on the error message, and copy the text of the message into a text editor (e.g. Notepad).</p> <p>Before contacting Inflectra\u00ae customer support with the specific error message, here are a couple of common causes for the above errors together with the appropriate resolutions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ASP.NET process account has been disabled Go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management and launch the Windows computer management console. Expand Local Users and Groups &gt; Users and then double-click on the 'ASPNET' account. Make sure that the ASPNET user is not disabled. If you are using Windows 2003 or 2008 Server the ASPNET user is set per-application pool and typically is set to the built-in NETWORKSERVICE account, so this won't apply.</p> </li> <li> <p>The ASP.NET process account does not have sufficient permissions Right-click on the C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319 folder (and any other versions of .NET that are listed) and make sure that the ASPNET, NETWORKSERVICE and LOCALSERVICE accounts are all listed with Full Control. If that doesn't fit the issue and you are using Windows 2003 or 2008 Server, open up the IIS manager and right-click on the Application Pool that KronoDesk\u00ae is running under and make sure that the identity listed has Full Control permissions on the same folders.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Windows Event Log is full Open up the Application and System event logs, right-click on the log name and choose Properties. Make sure that both are set to \"overwrite events as needed\". If they are not set to overwrite as needed, change the setting then manually clear both logs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the resolutions above were not able to resolve the issue, please send an email to support@inflectra.com and include the error message from both the web page and the Windows Event Logs.</p>","title":"Appendix A -- Troubleshooting"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Appendix-A----Troubleshooting/#missing-msdtc-issue","text":"<p>There is one common error that has been found with installations where Microsoft SQL Server was installed after IIS was installed. This typically affects only Windows XP Professional, but could occur in other situations. What happens is that the SQL Server installation inadvertently removes the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) service from the system during the installation.</p> <p>To determine if this is indeed the cause of the observed error, you need to click on Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Component Services:</p> <p></p> <p>Once the window has opened, expand the folders marked \"Component Services\", \"Computers\", \"My Computer\" and \"COM+ Applications\" in turn. If the window opens correctly and displays the information illustrated above, then your IIS 500 error is being caused by something else.</p> <p>However if you receive an error message that indicates an inability to connect with the \"Distributed Transaction Coordinator\", then you have to fix the MSDTC service to enable IIS and ASP.NET to operate properly.</p> <p>To fix the issue, you need to make changes to the Windows System Registry (hereafter referred to as \"the registry\"). This is a process that should not be attempted by novice users, since any incorrect changes can complete wreck the Windows installation, requiring a complete reinstallation of the operating system.</p> <p>To open the registry, click Start &gt; Run, and type \"Regedit.exe\" into the dialog box, and the registry will open:</p> <p></p> <p>Expand the folders marked \"My Computer\", \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\", \"SOFTWARE\" and \"Microsoft\" in turn and navigate to the folder marked \"MSDTC\". Click the &lt;Delete&gt; button on your keyboard, and click &lt;OK&gt; on the confirmation box. Now close the registry editor.</p> <p>Now you need to click on Start &gt;Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs and click on the tab marked \"Add/Remove Windows Components\":</p> <p></p> <p>Don't change any of the selected components, but instead simply click the &lt;Next&gt; button.

Since the 6.0 release of IIS, there is the ability to separate the web-server into different \"Application Pools\". Sometimes, web hosting companies will host multiple websites in the same application pool (which we do not recommend). When resources are maxed out for an application pool IIS 7 starts to recycle these sites causing application variables to be lost for those recycled sites. By default, KronoDesk installs on these operating systems in its own application pool.</p> <p>If you are experiencing application/session loss symptoms then we recommend asking your web hosting company to verify that your instance of KronoDesk is running in its own application pool with all recycling options disabled and the recycle worker process set to recycle only once during the day at a set time.</p> <p>To make these changes yourself, you need to follow these steps:</p> <p>Add new application pool for \"KronoDesk\" (if one does not already exist) and make sure it is set to use the .NET Framework v4.0 and the \"Integrated Pipeline\":</p> <p></p> <p>Next, choose your own application pool in the KronoDesk web site properties:</p> <p></p>","title":"Application Session Pooling Issues (Windows Vista, 7 or 2008)"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Appendix-B----Using-with-SSL/","text":"<p>This section outlines how you can install a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate onto IIS to allow users to access KronoDesk\u00ae via an encrypted protocol, so that usernames, passwords and sensitive project data cannot be \"sniffed\" across the network. This is especially important if your web-server is being accessed across the Internet.</p> <p>This section assumes that you already have a Certificate Authority (CA) available to generate an SSL certificate for you. This can either be a third-party provider (e.g. Verisign) or a tool used to generate \"self certificates\" that can be used internally to your organization. For more information on the differences between these two options, please read the following documents:</p> <p>http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/8d3bb71a-0a7f-443f-8084-908d0dab9caa.mspx?mfr=true (installing self or third-party certificate on Windows Server 2003)</p> <p>http://www.somacon.com/p42.php (installing self-certificate on Windows XP)</p> <p>Once you have decided how you will generate the certificate, you next need to generate the request for the certificate from your web server.

You can then choose to either prepare the certificate request and sent it later, or to send the certificate request immediately to an online CA. If you are using a third-party CA and are connected to the Internet choose the second option, otherwise choose the first option.</p> <p></p> <p>Enter the name for the certificate, typically this will contain the name of the organization, purpose of the certificate and any other pertinent information that will help you distinguish it.</p> <p>You should choose a bit-length of at least 2048 bits, and leave the other options unchecked unless you are using the server outside of the United States, in which case you will need to choose the \"Server Gated Cryptography (SGA)\" option. Click the &lt;Next&gt; button when you are finished.</p> <p></p> <p>Now enter the organization and organizational unit name that best describes who is requesting the certificate. Click &lt;Next&gt; when you are finished.</p> <p></p> <p>Next enter the \"common name\" for the web site that will be using the certificate. For a website that will be accessed across the Internet, this should the fully qualified domain name (e.g. www.mysite.com), whereas for a website that is limited to a local intranet, the computer name will suffice (e.g. myhost). Click &lt;Next&gt; when you are finished.</p> <p></p> <p>Next enter the country / region, state / province and city / locality that best describe where the web-server will operate or where the organizational entity resides. Once you are finished, click &lt;Next&gt;.</p> <p></p> <p>Next, enter the filename that you want to use for the certificate request file. This is the file that you will send to the Certificate Authority (CA) to request an SSL certificate. This filename should be memorable and describe what the certificate is for. The file extension should be .txt.

If you want to make changes, click the &lt;Back&gt; button, otherwise click &lt;Next&gt; to actually generate the certificate. Once finished, you will now have the certificate request file that you can send to the Certificate Authority (CA) to process your request.</p> <p>Once the CA has processed your request, they will send back the actual SSL certificate that you can install onto your web-sever. The next steps will describe how to install the certificate once you receive it back from the CA.</p> <p>Once you have received the SSL certificate back from the CA, save the file onto your hard-disk with the file-extension .cer. Now open up the IIS management console (as described above), right-click on the \"Default Web Site\" icon and choose \"Properties\". Now select the \"Directory Security\" tab, and click the button marked &lt;Server Certificate&gt; under the heading \"Secure Communications\". When the dialog box appears, choose the second option -- to process an existing request. This will bring up the following dialog box:</p> <p></p> <p>Now, browse to the place on your hard disk where you saved the SSL certificate (with extension .cer) and select the file you saved. Click &lt;Next&gt; to load the certificate.

To add a new workflow, simply click the [Add Workflow] button and a new workflow will be created with the standard KronoDesk steps and transitions.</p> <p>You can have as many workflows as you like in a project, but only one can be marked as the default. Each KronoDesk product is assigned to a workflow; this allows you to have support tickets for different products follow different paths from creation to closure. However when a new product is created, it will be initially associated with the default workflow. The steps and transitions that make up the default workflow are illustrated in the diagram below:</p> <p></p> <p>Note: You can only assign an active workflow to a KronoDesk product, and similarly you cannot make a workflow inactive that is currently linked to at least one product. This is important as all products need to be linked to an active workflow at all times.</p>","title":"Workflows"},{"location":"Administration-Guide/Workflows/#edit-workflow-details","text":"<p>Clicking on the &lt;Steps&gt; button of an inactive workflow brings up the following screen that lists all the workflow steps and workflow transitions that comprise the workflow:</p> <p></p> <p>This page lists in the left-most column all the various incident statuses defined in the system. The next column lists all the possible transitions that can occur from that status. In addition, with each transition is listed the name of the resulting destination status that the transition leads to.
