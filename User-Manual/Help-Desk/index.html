<h1 id="help-desk">Help Desk</h1>
<p>The KronoDeskÂ® help desk ticket management system provides the final
level of customer support. When a customer cannot readily find the
solution through either the knowledge base or support forums, they can
submit a help desk ticket through KronoDesk's help desk submission
system. The system allows them to quickly and easily enter the
description of the problem, attach any relevant documents or
screenshots, categorize the issue and then submit it for resolution by
the support agents.</p>
<h2 id="ticket-list">Ticket List</h2>
<p>When you click on the Help Desk option in the global navigation, you
will be taken to the main help desk page:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_50.png" /></p>
<p>This page displays on the left-hand side a list of display options for
viewing the help desk. The available option will depend on your role in
the system. In general customers can only see their submitted tickets
whereas customer support agents can see all the tickets in the system.</p>
<p>The following display options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>My Assigned Tickets</strong> -- This displays a list of all the open
tickets assigned to the current user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unassigned Tickets</strong> - This displays a list of all the open
tickets that are not assigned to any support agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My Opened Tickets</strong> - This displays a list of all the open tickets
that were opened by the current user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My Closed Tickets</strong> - This displays a list of all the closed
tickets that were opened by the current user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All Open Tickets</strong> -- This displays a list of all the open tickets
regardless of who opened them or who they are assigned to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All Closed Tickets</strong> - This displays a list of all the closed
tickets regardless of who opened them or who they are assigned to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All Tickets</strong> - This displays a list of all the tickets regardless
of their status, who opened them or who they are assigned to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there is an Operations pane that is displayed for support
agents and lets you perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assign Tickets to Me</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid
and then click this option, it will assign the selected tickets to
your user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assign Tickets to User</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main
grid and then click this option, it will allow you to assign the
selected tickets to a specific customer agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unassign Tickets</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and
then click this option, it will return the ticket to the unassigned
list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merge Tickets --</strong> If you select two or more tickets in the grid
(using SHIFT+click or CTRL+click) then click merge, the system will
combine them into a single ticket for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Tickets</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid, then
click this option, it will permanently delete the selected tickets.
Typically this is only used for tickets generated from spam emails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="filtering-and-sorting">Filtering and Sorting</h3>
<p>The main ticket grid allows you to filter and sort the ticket list. You
sort a column by simply clicking on the arrow in the header row. To
filter the ticket list, simply enter the text into the search box and
the ticket list will be automatically filtered:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_51.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to undo the filter, simply clear the filter and the full
ticket list will be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="changing-columns">Changing Columns</h3>
<p>To show and hide different columns in the ticket grid, click on the
columns icon above the grid and the column selector will be displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_52.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have chosen the columns to display or hide simply click away
from the dialog and the column selector will close and the grid will be
reloaded with the new columns.</p>
<h3 id="auto-refreshing">Auto-Refreshing</h3>
<p>Sometimes as a support agent it is useful to have the ticket list
auto-refresh every couple of seconds to ensure that you are seeing the
most up-to-date information. Clicking on the "Auto Refresh" icon will
enable this feature.</p>
<h3 id="export-to-excel">Export to Excel</h3>
<p>To export the current list of tickets to an Excel Comma Separated Values
(CSV) file, simply click on the 'Excel' icon and the current ticket list
will be exported into an MS-Excel compatible CSV file:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_53.png" /></p>
<h3 id="context-menu">Context Menu</h3>
<p>KronoDeskÂ® provides a handy shortcut for performing frequent operations
on the ticket list. Simply hover the mouse over the ticket grid and
click the right mouse button. This brings up the context menu:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_54.png" /></p>
<p>You can use this to perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assign Tickets to Me</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid
and then click this option, it will assign the selected tickets to
your user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assign Tickets to User</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main
grid and then click this option, it will allow you to assign the
selected tickets to a specific customer agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unassign Tickets</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid and
then click this option, it will return the ticket to the unassigned
list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merge Tickets --</strong> If you select two or more tickets in the grid
(using SHIFT+click or CTRL+click) then click merge, the system will
combine them into a single ticket for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Tickets</strong> -- If you select ticket(s) in the main grid, then
click this option, it will permanently delete the selected tickets.
Typically this is only used for tickets generated from spam emails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-new-ticket">Create New Ticket</h2>
<p>If you click on the hyperlink to "Open Ticket", the system will display
the new help desk ticket entry page:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_55.png" /></p>
<p>This page displays the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Opener</strong> -- When a customer support agent opens a ticket, they are
opening it on behalf of a customer (for instance during a phone
call). You can type a name, email address, or organization name into
this field to get a list of possible matches. When a customer opens
a ticket they do not see this field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product</strong> -- Each ticket has to be assigned to a specific product,
which can be selected from the dropdown list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subject/Description</strong> -- This section of the page allows you to
enter the subject and long description of the customer's support
issue. The long description allows formatted text and can include
lists, tables and hyperlinks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ticket Fields --</strong> This section displays all the fields that need
to be filled out when submitting the ticket. The fields that are
required are displayed in <strong>bold type</strong> with an asterisk(*) next to
the field name. When you change the product name field that may
change the workflow associated with the ticket. If that happens, you
will see some of the fields change.
This is normal and allows the administrator to tailor the fields
required to the type of product (e.g. a web application may need you
to enter the browser type, whereas a mobile application would need
to know the cellphone network)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attachments</strong> -- This section is described in more detail below in
<a href="#adding-a-document-attachment">Adding a Document Attachment</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that when a customer is creating a ticket, KronoDesk will
dynamically search the knowledge base to see if there are any articles
that could answer their question, based on what they enter as the
ticket's subject:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_56.png" /></p>
<h3 id="adding-a-document-attachment">Adding a Document Attachment</h3>
<p>You can drag and drop files onto the attachment area:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_57.png" /></p>
<p>As you add documents, they will appear in this control. To add a new
attachment to the ticket, either drag and drop the files onto this
control or click on the arrow to browse your local file system. Once the
documents are attached they will be listed below the attachment area:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_58.png" /></p>
<p>You can remove any items by selecting the item and clicking the "Delete
Selected" x.</p>
<p><em>Note: The system uses file extensions to identity the type of file, so
if your local operating system doesn't use file extensions, you may want
to rename the file before uploading (e.g. changing MyDocument to
MyDocument.pdf to identity it as an Acrobat document).</em></p>
<h3 id="adding-a-screenshot">Adding a Screenshot</h3>
<p>To include a screenshot in your ticket, first copy the image to your
computer's clipboard (e.g. on Windows computers, the PRINT SCREEN button
captures the current page and adds to the clipboard). Once the image is
in the clipboard, position the cursor in the ticket Description text box
where you want it to appear and then click CTRL+V to paste the image.</p>
<p>The image will then be attached to the ticket and embedded in the rich
text box.</p>
<h2 id="ticket-details">Ticket Details</h2>
<p>If you click on the hyperlink for a specific ticket in either the main
ticket list page, one of the user dashboards, or the navigation sidebar,
you will be taken to the details page for the specific ticket:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_59.png" /></p>
<p>This page is made up of three areas; the sidebar (left), the header (top
right), and the journal (bottom right).</p>
<p>The sidebar has two views. In both views there is a submit button at
top. By default the sidebar shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>information about the opener of the ticket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an uploader area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a list of custom fields</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternate view of the sidebar is to show lists of relevant tickets
to the user and can be used to quickly jump to other tickets. You can
switch between these two views at any time by clicking the button in the
top left (just to the left of the submit button).</p>
<p>The header contains the ticket name and other important meta-data.</p>
<p>The journal contains information associated with the activity taken over
the course of the ticket. There are up to four types of data that the
journal shows. Each user can show or hide the information based on their
needs, by clicking the filter buttons, or change the sort order to be by
date ascending or descending.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_59.png" /></p>
<p>The four types of information shown in the journal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes --</strong> the description of the original ticket plus a list of
all the notes added by support personnel and the original submitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attachments</strong> -- any file added to the ticket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incidents</strong> -- If you have the integration with SpiraTeamÂ®
enabled, you will see any incidents (defects, bugs, change requests,
etc.) related to the current ticket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>History</strong> --shows you the change history for the ticket.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changing-fields-and-statuses">Changing Fields and Statuses</h3>
<p>When editing an existing ticket, the fields that are available and the
fields that are required will depend on your stage in the ticket
workflow. For example, an open ticket might not require an "Assignee"
whereas an assigned ticket typically would not. The types of change
allowed and the email notifications that are sent will depend on how the
system administrator has configured the workflow. Administrators should
refer to the <em>KronoDesk Administration Guide</em> for details on configuring
the ticket workflows to meet their needs. The workflow controls both the
meta-data fields shown in the header, as well as any custom fields shown
in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Depending on the user's role and whether they are listed as the opener
or assignee of the ticket, displayed in the top-left of the header, is a
dropdown list with the allowed workflow operations:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_60.png" /></p>
<p>These workflow transitions allow the user to move the ticket from one
status to another. For example in the default workflow, when the ticket
is in the Assigned status, you will be given the options to change the
status to one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Open"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Waiting on Customer"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Waiting on Development"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Duplicate"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Non-Issue"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After changing the status of the ticket by clicking on the workflow
link, you can then fill in the additional fields that are now enabled
and/or required. Once you've made the changes to the appropriate ticket
fields, click on the "Submit" button in the sidebar (at the top left of
the screen).</p>
<p>Some transitions may require a digital signature. In the workflow
dropdown, those transitions will be marked with a lock symbol. Upon
saving, you will be given a prompt:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_61.png" /></p>
<p>You must re-enter in your password, and an additional reason/meaning for
the transition before the application will allow you to save your
changed.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-journal-to-view-comments">Using the Journal to view comments</h3>
<p>The journal displays the entire history of a ticket, and most
importantly all communication between agents and the customer. All
messages from customers are shown in one color background (pale yellow
in the default application theme). All messages to customers from agents
are in a different color (light gray in the default application theme).
Clicking at the top of each message / note will expand or collapse that
note, to help scrolling through long tickets, or reviewing new
information. Using the button at the top of the journal, you can also
expand or collapse all comments at once.</p>
<p>Here all comments are expanded:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_62.png" /></p>
<p>And here they are all collapsed:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_63.png" /></p>
<p>Any notes that are 'internal only' and therefore only visible to
customer support agents, are displayed with a red background (in the
default application theme) with a mute icon at the top left:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_64.png" /></p>
<h3 id="adding-notes">Adding Notes</h3>
<p>You can reply to a ticket at any time by clicking the reply button in
the journal toolbar (the rightmost button):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_65.png" /></p>
<p>You can also reply using any reply button on any expanded ticket note.
This will show the reply window directly underneath that note. You can
even start replying to one note and then click on another note to move
the reply window to that second note. The new note / reply will always
get added to the ticket in the same way, but it can be helpful to
'attach' the reply window to a specific note you need to refer to in a
reply.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_66.png" /></p>
<p>You need to enter the note text in the rich-text box. As soon as you do
you will see the button to the bottom left of the reply window become
active and say "Submit". Click this will save all changes to the ticket
and add the note to the ticket at the same time.</p>
<p>If you would like to insert a Knowledge Base (KB) article into your
reply to the user, you can click on the link "Add KB to Note" (this is
only visible to agents):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_67.png" /></p>
<p>You then select the KB article from the available list, choose the type
of link to insert (name and link only, full article text, etc.). Then
click the 'Insert Template' to populate the note with the KB article
link/text. There are a number of templates you can use. These are all
configurable by the application administrator.</p>
<p>To include a screenshot in your note, first copy the image to your
computer's clipboard (e.g. on Windows computers, the PRINT SCREEN button
captures the current page and adds to the clipboard). Once the image is
in the clipboard, position the cursor in the Note text box where you
want it to appear and then click CTRL+V to paste the image.</p>
<p>The image will then be attached to the ticket and embedded in the note
text.</p>
<h3 id="ccs-to-a-ticket">CC's to a Ticket</h3>
<p>With KronoDesk's cc functionality, a user can make sure other interested
parties are copied in to all email notifications about a ticket. If a
user creates a ticket via email and adds cc's to that email, they will
automatically be added as a cc to the ticket.</p>
<p>You can tell that a ticket has cc's on them by looking at the ticket
header -- there is a cc badge to the left of the ticket name:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_68.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_69.png" /></p>
<p>To view and edit the cc's on the ticket (any valid email address can be
used), click on downward facing arrow on the right hand side of the
ticket header (the "more actions" button).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_70.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_71.png" /></p>
<h3 id="attachments">Attachments</h3>
<p>The attachments pane of the sidebar gives a drag and drop area for
adding files to a ticket. Files added in the current editing session
(before clicking "Submit") are shown below the attachment pane. Older
files are shown in the journal. The documents can be in any format,
though KronoDeskÂ® will only display the icon for certain known types:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_72.png" /></p>
<p>The attachment list includes the filename/URL that was originally
uploaded together with the file-size (in KB), name of the person who
attached it and the date uploaded.</p>
<p>To actually view the document, simply click on the filename hyperlink
and a new web browser window will open. Depending on the type of file,
this window will either display the document / web-page or prompt you
for a place to save it on your local computer. To remove an existing
attachment from a ticket, simply select the item and click the
[Delete] button.</p>
<p>To attach a new document to the ticket, you simply drag them onto the
attachment upload control or click on the upload button and then browse
to find the file on your local filesystem.</p>
<p><em>Note: The system uses file extensions to identity the type of file, so
if your local operating system doesn't use file extensions, you may want
to rename the file before uploading (e.g. changing MyDocument to
MyDocument.pdf to identity it as an Acrobat document).</em></p>
<h3 id="incidents">Incidents</h3>
<p>SpiraTeamÂ® incidents linked to the current help desk ticket are shown in
the journal (as long as the current user has permission to view them).
If you see the following message, it means that your user profile in
KronoDesk has not been linked to an equivalent SpiraTeam user profile.
To fix the issue, click on the "user profile" link and enter your
SpiraTeam RSS Token into your KronoDesk user profile. This is described
in more detail in <a href="../User-Profile/#edit-profile">Edit Profile</a></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_73.png" /></p>
<p>Once your KronoDesk user is linked to a corresponding SpiraTeam user,
you will see a list of SpiraTeam incidents that were generated from the
current ticket in the journal, organized with other journal items based
on the date the incident was created:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_74.png" /></p>
<p>Each incident is displayed together with its incident ID, name, status,
owner, and last update date. Hovering over the incident name will give a
tooltip of the incident description. Clicking on the incident
name/hyperlink will open the incident in SpiraTeam in a new window.</p>
<p>This allows support agents to view the status of the incidents use it to
determine when the ticket can be resolved because the underlying product
issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>To log a new incident in SpiraTeam based on the current help desk
ticket, click on downward facing arrow on the right hand side of the
ticket header (the "more actions" button).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_70.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_75.png" /></p>
<p>To "Add New Incident" make sure a SpiraTeam project is selected from the
dropdown list (if the name of the product for the ticket matches the
name of any Spirateam project, that project will be automatically
selected for you):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_76.png" /></p>
<p>This dialog lets you add a new incident to the linked instance of
SpiraTeam. The system will prepopulate the description of the incident
with the ticket description. You can edit this text or clear it
completely and enter in custom content.</p>
<p>You then need to enter an incident name, and choose values for other
fields based on what fields are required (this is set inside SpiraTeam
on a project by project basis). Once you are satisfied, click "Add" to
add the incident to SpiraTeam. Once the incident has been added, it will
appear in the KronoDesk journal.</p>
<p><em>Note: You need to make sure that the SpiraTeam user that you have
associated with your KronoDesk profile has permissions to create new
incidents in that project in SpiraTeam.</em></p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>The journal displays the list of changes that have been performed on the
help desk ticket artifact since its creation. An example ticket change
history is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Help_Desk_77.png" /></p>
<p>The change history displays the date that each change was made, together
with the fields that were changed, the old and new values and the person
who made the change. This allows a complete audit trail to be maintained
of all changes in the system.</p>
<h3 id="navigating-tickets-using-the-sidebar">Navigating tickets using the sidebar</h3>
<p>When viewing the sidebar as a list of tickets, you will see links to
take you back to the ticket list and to create a new ticket. There will
also be a list of peer tickets to the one selected. This latter list is
useful as a navigation shortcut; you can quickly view the peer tickets
by clicking on the navigation links without having to first return to
the ticket list page. The navigation list can be switched between four
different modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The list of tickets matching the current filter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of all tickets, irrespective of the current filter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of tickets assigned to the current user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of tickets opened by the current user</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-more-efficiently-using-keyboard-shortcuts">Working More Efficiently Using Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Press the question mark symbol on your keyboard to bring up a list of
available keyboard shortcuts. These should allow you to operate the
entire ticket details page without requiring a mouse and can greatly
speed up your workflow as you reply to, and manage your tickets.</p>
